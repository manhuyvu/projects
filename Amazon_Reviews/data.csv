0,5,Worked soon as I plugit in,I bought the 4tb Model for 99 bucks for my xbox 1x. Soon as I plugged it in it worked. The Seagate was very user friendly..I was transferring storage with in 1 minute of plug in for the price and 4tb Wow thats what I was looking for..Thanks Amazon for the price and shipping I had it 2 days after ordering it... With larger storage games coming out in 2023 your going to need a lot of storage on the Xbox...Very happy withthis purchase...Buy..Buy...Buy.
1,1,The single worst product ever produced.,"I bought my one touch device at staples. I loaded everything on it for storage and deleted it from my computer. 3 week go by and all my data is corrupted! Photos, documents all gone. Do not trust or buy this product if you want to use it as storage for anything important."
2,4,Works good but can be hacked easily.,Buy something more expensive. But they do work good.
3,1,Inaccurate Item Description,"The item description specifies that it's compatible with PC, Mac, and Playstation, etc. However, the drive I received is only compatible with a Chromebook or a PC. Faulty advertising that needs to be corrected."
4,1,Terrible,"Terrible won't connect to my laptop, Playstation or pc.Unreadable but clearly is on. Waste of money. Smfh"
5,1,Does not work with Mac OS Monterey (2022),"Don't bother if you are using a mac, previous tips in comments don't work (at least not any more). Not even detected with Disk Utility. Also feels like cheap flimsy plastic, the entire thing caves in with the slightest pressure."
6,5,PlayStation,"I use it on my PS4 and it’s great, I would recommend it’s worth the money I’ve had it for a while and it’s running great 10/10 !!"
7,5,Gift for my Son,Bought this as a gift for my Son for one of his gaming systems and he loves it. Said it works perfectly.
8,5,So far so good.,My old computer crashed and the hard drive died. I paid the money to have the files recovered from my old computer which was put on a 1 TB drive. I copied everything from that drive to this 2 TB drive. I'm very satisfied so far.
9,5,Great gift for any true gamer!,I had bought this for my son for his 13th birthday and he loves it. It was easy for him to connect and he started downloading all the games he could! Lol
10,3,Small but slow,"Drive worked and passed the tests that could be done, though official Seagate software isn't as good as other 3rd party stuff sadly. It's small but not the smallest out there. The biggest problem is it's very slow especially compared with the WD alternative though this actually works more than a week.If you get drives today, always get two and back everything up twice because they seem to fail more than they once did unfortunately."
11,1,Stopped working after awhile,"Hardrive stopped working after using it the other day, I don’t really think it should be sold if it can’t even last a year performing like every other basic hardrive."
12,5,Seagate Support is Excellent,"This EHD worked great right out of the box and was perfect for me needs.Until, unfortunately, the plug in jack got loose and I could no longer get a good connection to my laptop.It was still under warranty and had rescue service with it as well.I called Seagate support and they promptly sent me a paid label to return the drive.They emailed me when it was recieved and at each step in the process.Within 2 weeks, I had a new hard drive with all of my data recovered back to it.So good to know that the warranty did in fact work out when I needed it.I will be more careful plugging and unplugging in the future."
13,3,Drive failed,"Waited almost 2 years to review, without ever dropping or damaging in anyway, drive obtained the ability to summon from the depths of hell the click of death, drive no longer reads or operates in any form or fashion related to proper operationGreat drive very short lifespan"
14,2,Missing a full TB of space!,"I own more external storage devices. Non lose an entire Tb worth of space do to default formatting.I tried to reformat the drive still a full 1tb of space missing. That's not excusable, I would not recommend this product ."
15,4,Awesome,Great
16,5,Great back up!,"Great for backup of photos. As the saying goes one is none and two is one! A little on the noisy side, but for a back up it seems to do the job at a great price."
17,1,Failed when about 75% full.,Worked fine until I asked it to hold more than 4T.
18,5,Easy to use.,Just like any other drives on your laptop.
19,5,Great way to back up your Anything!,I bought this 8 tb ext hd to replace a 3 tb 2014 unit that died. It works much faster besides the additional 5 tb of storage. Highly recommend buying one of these.
20,5,Su servicio,"Me agrado mucho en tenerlo, aunque pensé que no llegaría, lo nesesito para guardar muchas cosas."
21,1,"They said this was ""like new"" lol","The media could not be loaded. Do NOT believe ""like new"" requested a refund within minutes if getting it."
22,5,superb exteriior storage,These are life savers for those of us who download a lot of photos or paperwork for projects that you like to transport to & from work and home.Recommended
23,5,High quality,"Great dependable, high quality. You will be grateful you bought"
24,2,Should of tested right when received it,Doesn’t work properly got from Amazon for my son he was out of state doesn’t work like should sadly
25,5,Go to,This is my go to external hard drive. Always works for me.
26,5,The price turned out to be more than what was displayed for this item.,I use this product to store my most important documents.
27,1,Beware Seagate Bearing Wares,"After buying this product, I'm left wondering if there's a difference between storage device companies or am I just experiencing bad luck. I had nothing but problems with Western Digital products, so I stopped buying from them. I tried Seagate and never had any problems up until now, so I bought this product and poured my extensive video collection (the product of over a decade of collecting) into it, figuring that because of its storage capacity i might never have to buy another device. As usual, i was pleased at first, but, after three months, it just up and failed. I now have to send the device to Seagate to see if the all the data can be recovered, which is not a sure thing. I'm sure others out there can sympathize with frustration and anxiety I'm currently experiencing. So, beware of this product; consider carefully before sinking your hard-earned money that may so cruelly disappoint you."
28,3,Bought as a gift,"Bought as a gift. Based on personal history, Seagate has been a good brand for many years so I purchased this one for my son. Appears to be very portable and durable for a hard drive. Price was very good for the data size capacity."
29,5,Finally some storage!,This is a Yule gift for my son. Can't wait for him to open it up. He will finally be able to have more than on game at a time on his console.
30,1,Not Reliable,I’m and videographer and I haven’t even had this for a week. It already crashed and I’ve lost all footage totaled to 6TB.
31,1,"too complicated to use, no live support","Product is not plug and play, very difficult to use with no live tech support. They have chat support but they cannot see your screen so it is very complicated to show them what is going on the computer."
32,5,Works as described,"My old Seagate or WD was making clicking noises which means it’s about to crap out.Fortunately I was able to transfer all my data to the new HD and I’m good for another few years, I hope."
33,2,sad and pathetic,Certainly NOT a gaming drive! I'm pretty certain I have floppies from the 80's that record data faster.I suggest finding either a defferent model of a different vendor.There is NOTHING 3.0 about this drive!
34,4,Ideal para tener respaldos en casa,He tenido buenas experiencias con Seagate.
35,5,"Small, compact, with lots of storage",Small and compact but has lots of storage.Easy to use.Didn't need tech support (the Seagate worked great after plugging into laptop) but I give this item 5 stars since it seems like a quality product.
36,1,No good,Purchased8/21 and 12/22 it no longer works very disappointed makes a humming flutter noise and cant retreive data now everything is lost
37,5,Giftfor family member,My son uses this with his PS3. He loves it!
38,5,Great drive,It was just what I needed to use with time machine to back up my computer.
39,3,Very Slow Transfer Rate - Perhaps My Cable?,"Connected this 8 TB hard drive with USB-C to Micro B, transfer rate up to 10Gbps.USB-C is connected to desktop and Micro B to Seagate hard drive.I transferred about 189 GB of data from my old hard drive to this new hard drive.The data transfer took about a whole day. The transfer speed didn't even reach 1MB.Maybe the data transfer file was too large.The drive is somewhat noisy when copying data.Anyway, I'm disappointed."
40,1,failed miserably,"the unit simply will not work after a short time of use, very dissapointed"
41,1,5TB 2.5 External Does Not Survive Long,"I got the 5tb 2.5 inch external drive hoping it would be good enough to sit quietly on my desk for occasional use. Well here we are 1 year and 3 months later. This this is 3 months out of protection and has an entire 321 hours of use and has failed miserably. Save yourself the heartache and just avoid seagate drives. I have stacks of failed seagate drives at this point, mostly the 1.5 and 2tb 3.5 inch drives. I'll be sticking with Hitachi and Western Digital from now on."
42,5,Works as advertised,Works as advertised
43,4,Does not have a USB input,"You need a separate cable to input from your phone. I needed something to backup my laptop and my phone and to move files between them when I don't have good internet, which is most of the time. Will review again when I get the right cord."
44,1,DO NOT BUY DRIVE FAILED IN 9 MONTHS,Maybe I got a dud because after a few months I started have occasional issues. All data was inexplicably lost and if I can even get the drive to open it immediately crashes when I open a folder.
45,5,storage capacity,liked everything
46,5,Works well,"Easy to use, very small and portable, when used it doesn't generate a lot of heat"
47,5,Works fine,"This is the second brand of external hard drive i have used, and it works as intended. USB 3.0 is fast to transfer files, it’s small, light, and portable."
48,5,So far so good!,This us my second 8tb.Thr first one had a faulty port so let's see if this one meets my daily needs.
49,5,Lots of storage,Have put a lot of different files and there is still a lot of space. Easy to use and transfer stuff. This being my first one has made it very simple.
50,5,Awesome!,It works perfectly!
51,1,Trash You will lose data,very slow. worked ok for a few years. Now I have bad 100+ ncorrectable sector count. lost some files. seagate is not to be trusted.
52,5,Took some set up time but so far so good,We have a Macbook.It was a little bit more complicated trying to format but we figured it out.Love the price for the memory.Hope this lasts with no issues!
53,5,It’s alright!!!,"It’s good, not much to say. It portable but for some reason mines a little slow putting in my game clips in it but overall would recommend"
54,3,Not actually 18TB,This drive actually has 16TB for storage.
55,5,Works great for Ps4,Been using this for my ps4 since they day I got it and it's worked perfectly just fine. If you're looking for A external for your consoles then this is a great option.
56,5,Great added storage for a great price,"I have an Xbox and wanted more storage and this was what I needed. Great item, great seller, great price. Def worth the money spent."
57,1,Incredibly slow write speed,I bought these drives to simply use as an affordable backup options for some video content. They were writing at USB 2.0 speeds. Copies that should only take 40 minutes were saying 5 plus hours. I purchased two drives and both were the same performance. I also plugged in alternative drives to see if it was a computer issue and tried on two computers. It is simply the drives. I do not recommend these to anyone.
58,5,Good drive,"These are quick and easy to use. Wish they where cheaper but you get what you pay for haha. They are really good about fixing problems too, at least in the past they have been. However times have changed"
59,5,External hard drive for Xbox One,A great hard drive for a Xbox One.It's It's spinninghard drive e but performs well a d 5tb for the $was a good deal.
60,5,Reliablity,Backing my lab top
61,1,JUNK LASTED TWO MONTHS,JUNK
62,4,6 months,I brought this back in July and it worked perfectly. it made me play the Sims 4 heaven for my added cc but just recently in December now it doesn't work. i can't even locate it on my computer and now 6 months' worth of files are lost... im very upset. it should work longer than that time frame i suggest if you do buy have another on standby to move all of your files to the other as a duplicate im very sad right now
63,1,"Says it will work with my Xbox one S, but lies",This device is suppose to be an expansion storage card for my xbox. But I still can't play games from it. Not worth the money.Absolute trash
64,1,Died in less than 2 years,This hard drive worked just fine for 1 year and 8 months.It then died and so I ran a CHKDSK - It then worked for 2 days and died again.I was fortunate to have had those 2 days in which I promptly backed up the contents of the drive. I'm replacing it with a much more reliable Samsung 2 TB solid state drive.If I need more capacity I'll buy a second Samsung 2 TB solid state drive - No moving parts and the Samsung brand = a much more reliable and longer lasting drive.
65,1,Horrible,"Compre uno de estos y solo duró 15 días. Ya no se conecta. Sientes el motor fucinando pero da error y no se conecta. Intente con otros cables, en otros puertos, en otras PC y nada. No lo volveré a comprar nunca en mi vida"
66,2,WARNING - Seagate will NOT support you when this drive fails!,I've had this drive for 3 years. In the past couple of weeks it would randomly disconnect from my computer. Today I pulled the power cable out of the port in the back and the metal housing the cable fits into came out with it. I now have a useless drive and no way to access the data. Called Seagate and was told they would do nothing since the serial number has rubbed off the bottom of the drive and I can't read it anymore.Do NOT buy this brand!
67,5,Reliable and high quality,I have been using this daily for about 2 years and still works great. Highly reccomend
68,5,Respaldo,En el momento es el medio más practico para respaldar los archivos.
69,1,Worked for 9 days,I'm done with Seagate products. This worked great.... For 9 days. Now it's not being recognized by any PC in my house. Junk
70,5,Just plug and play,"I bought this over a year ago for my Xbox One S and it is still going strong, just install any heavy multiplayer games like Warzone or R6 Siege to your console to avoid lag. You most likely won't lag but it's best to be safe. Also, Fallout 4 might be laggier if you install it on your EHD with mods running. Other than those specific games everything runs perfectly. I recommend to everyone because it is excellent for such a cheap price."
71,5,Amazing space and easy setup,The size on this is amazing. I’m able to store many many large games and save files for my work on this drive. Would recommend if you enjoy games and don’t have enough space or just need to store a lot
72,5,Xbox Series S,"I can confirm that this external hard drive works with the xbox series s. The only problem is that you cannot play optimised games for the series x/s on the drive, but that will always be the case no matter what external hard drive or ssd you get for your series x/s. You can store optimised games on the drive, but you cannot play them unless you move them into the internal storage. You can still play any other games on the hard drive as long as it is not optimised for the console. Only problem I actually have with this drive is that it's actually about 1.8tb, but I assume every other 2tb hard drive has the same problem."
73,5,Best Tech Support Ever !!!!!!,"I got this item because I lost information from a computer crash once before and didn't wanna chance it again.So I extracted all I needed from the old to transfer to the new ad store what I need to from the new, you know just in case.Was using Window but new computer is Windows 11 and the Seagate had to be tuned to act accordingly which led to me contacting CS.Wish I would have got the techs name to mention him here but I promise you the service provided was unprecedented.He was very knowledgeable and surefooted of himself, spoke well and there was no hanging on the line as he got right to it, solved it and assured I had received the BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME.A very satisfying experience"
74,5,Just what I needed,"I've been using flash drives to hold all my various work projects and files, and they were getting hard to manage. This turned out to be the perfect solution - I simply named a folder after each flash drive and copied the files over. It was astonishingly fast, even when using older flash drives through a hub. This drive even fits in the same wallet I use to carry those flash drives!"
75,5,It Meets My Expectations!,"Well, as someone who has been unfortunate to be exposed to useless hard drives sold in my country, It was a relief getting high quality hard drives and SSD from Amazon. Overall cost to ship these items to Nigeria makes the price unappealing. However, I will rather spend that extra dollars for shipping than buying a useless hard drive that will die in a matter of months or won't even work at all. I bought 2 of these hard drives. No complaints so far.."
76,5,Excellent quality,Great hard drive.It meets and exceeds all my needs.Great value for the price.
77,3,Misleading product description,Says compatible with Mac when it is not
78,1,Don’t buy it,This is a scam I been trying to upload for a minute won’t let me download or send files or nothing to this things it’s all bad
79,1,stopped working after 2 months,crap product stopped working after 2 months
80,5,Seems to work just fine,"Standing in for a failed data drive on my desktop. It seems to work just fine, and the capacity is excellent."
81,5,"Portable, large capacity storage",Easily works in my win/iOS mixed environment. Large capacity for photo and video projects. Fast enough.
82,2,Failed after hardly any use,"I had it for a few years but had only made a backup to it a couple of times.I was going to start using it again, but every time I backed up to it, there was corruption.Smartctl reported a bunch of uncorrectable errors (187)."
83,1,Sent me the internals,Just the inside of the drive came. No USB port or shell
84,5,Very good product,I have used this for almost 1.5 years and it still running fine without any problem!
85,4,Large enough drives for most backing up needs of an average personal computer,I order two for backing up 2 computers a windows 11 work laptop and a personal Linux machine the drive works out of box with windows 11. For Linux you have to reformat the whole drive to Ext 4. Delete all partitionsThen reformat it will work. Note that windows 21 H2 has a left over Windows 7 tool for backing up your computer if you don't want to use cloud services.
86,5,Great Choice,"My First ever Seagate hard drive ,won't be my last, very pleased with this drive , using it on my Roku Ultra, works flawlessly, right out of the box. Have had absolutely no issues at all. Last WD. Drive I purchased was dead on arrival. Not this one , works great. Good price too. Thanks"
87,5,Good quality,"Working as good external hard drive, I am happy with that."
88,5,Have gotten two of these and both have been perfect.,"Great ""back-ups"". I have four SeaGates (500g, 1T & 2x2T) and am pleased with all of them. Great quality. Used with Windows 10, they're completely ""Plug & Play"", with ""drag & drop"" file transfer.Can honestly say: Buy with confidence."
89,5,Works as expected with no issues,"So far seems like a great little external hard drive.No issues getting it up and running, though as an FYI for some others out there if it doesn't work when you plug it into a USB connection, try another one on your computer.This happened to me but is not tied into the Seagate drive as I have this with many other USB drives, some USB connectors on my computer just don't want to read a drive."
90,5,Cheap and cheerful backup storage.,Don't risk losing your data by saving a few bucks on one of those no-name hard drive brands.No brand is perfect or immune from drive failure but your best bet is to go with a name like Seagate.
91,3,Only 14.5 TB,"I know externals all lie about the true storage, but a whole 1.5 TB difference is kind of big.Granted i know ill probably never fill even half of this.SO far its working fine, but it is alot noisier than my last External.Uploading files and watching videos from it it working fine, i use it mainly for storage of all my videos and photos."
92,5,Exactly as advertised,Exactly as advertised
93,5,Fantastic,I love Seagate portable external drive! I had one before but it ran out of space! This is my second Seagate external drive! It is very easy to use! Highly recommended if anyone is interested.
94,3,Did not work with my MacBook Pro,Did not work with my MacBook Pro even though it stated it in the description.
95,5,A must have device,"This is just what my Apple tech guy told me I needed.Thank you, jw"
96,5,Works well,"Works great for my needs, easy setup. I just connected to my laptop and it did the rest. It is small and very portable. Granted, I have only used it to store about 190 GB so far, so I can't speak to the reviews that state that once they are half full there are problems. I have not had to deal with tech support either, so I have no comments there. I have used other Seagate drives in the past and have had no problems, for what it's worth."
97,1,"Took Overnight To Transfer 500GB- Slow, only buy if you are in no rush to read or write anything",SLOW AS MOLASSES
98,5,Gift buy,I purchased this for my son. I haven't heard any complaints about it from him it seems to be working all this time just fine since I bought it. It was a good deal
99,1,NOT FOR MACS - PLEASE DO NOT FALSE ADVERTISE,"it's quite annoying when you needed the portable to come on time and found out that you can't use it on Mac, please remove the feature where you can use it on Mac"
100,1,Failed after 1month,Drive starting failing after less than a month.Feels like a cheap plastic external case. I would not buy this again.
101,5,Works on my PS4!,"My product came on time and was in perfect condition! No damage on the packaging or the hard drive.I bought the 5TB external hard drive for my PS4 and it works great! I connected the given cable to my port on my PS4 and immediately worked. I instantly converted my drive to format properly on the ps4 and began downloading apps and games that I couldn’t do before! Although keep in mind, if you use this hard drive for another device or vice versa, the data must be deleted. I got that warning before formatting- just to let you know!In general, if you need extra storage space, I definitely recommend this! Also, the device is really small, matter of fact it’s roughly the size of one’s palm of their hand."
102,1,does not work with my Mac,is not compatible with my Mac computer
103,5,Really good,"My computer was working very slow because the disk capacity was full, but once I connected the sea gate portable external hard drive my computer is running very smoothThank youA bec"
104,1,It keeps breaking,"The media could not be loaded. I always bought Seagate portable hard drives.I decided to get a20 TB external harddrive Seagate specifically, hoping, since it was more expensive than Western Digital, that it would be better.It is not.Every time I must move my laptop and I disconnect the hard drive through the USB C chord, when I reconnect it, I can't drag anything on it anymore and I must always move it to a PC to fix the drive.It is extremely invonvenient.I keep getting messages that ""this drive can't be fixed"" and it can be fixed only through a PC computer.I don't want to fix the drive every time I need to use it.And my main mac can't fix it.Just to compare, I bought a Western Digital 20 TB Drive for a fraction of the cost, on sale for about $380 and the Western Digital 20 TB hard drive never gave me such issues.I have made a conscious decision to not buy Seagate anymore.Western Digital always works and my 12 year old Western Digital drive I still have, still works smoothly without any issues whatsoever.I have no idea why I decided to switch to Seagate.I guess I must have figguered that if it is more expensive that somehow it is better.Well, I've had two Seagate drives give me issues so far and none of the Western Digital ones ever stopped working."
105,1,Not 14T as advertised,I paid extra to get the 14t for the extra space but in reality it was only 12t.What a rip-off!!!
106,5,Works well with Xbox Series X,Affordable storage for Xbox games
107,1,I wouldn't trust this product with anything important,"Unfortunately was trying to use this to store mass video content because it's high resolution meaning massive file sizes. I've only been using for a few months and it's broken. Lost important files that literally can't be replaced. I'm extremely disappointed. Writing this review in hopes that two things will happen: 1. Seagate will help me recover these files somehow, and 2. They will replace the faulty product. I couldn't be more let down by this. Countless memories lost."
108,5,Still works great after almost a year!,I have had my 5tb for almost year now connected to the PS4 and it's still working great!!I've had No issues was easy to connect thinking of getting another one.
109,5,Will buy again,Satisfied
110,5,I’m going to buy another one !!,"Excellent transfer, slim easy to carry on, work fast on Xbox x/s"
111,2,Not sure how long this will last,So far so good. No issues yet.Update after a month of periodic use: The drive has begun to make concerning grinding noises. Not sure how long the data on the device will last.
112,1,Faulty hardware. Loss of files.,After less than two hours of opening hard drive malfunctioned. Started buzzing and is no longer discoverable on computer or disk management.Do not recommended this product. Lost 20 GB of files.
113,5,Veloz y eficaz en Playstation 5,The media could not be loaded. Trabaja bien y fue reconocido por mi Playstation 5
114,1,Unreliable,"The storage capacity and the portability drew me in back when I first started shopping around, and it was an excellent price too. So I bought this to store all of my unity projects and it worked great ... for the first day.Now it disconnects randomly without any warning, and I'm paranoid all of my work is going to be corrupted, so I refuse to use it until I find a suitable replacement and, hopefully, retrieve all of my files. Find yourself something a little more reliable, especially if your files contain days, sometimes weeks, worth of work; you'll thank yourself for it later."
115,1,Used once and it failed,"Used once to download data and the next time I plugged it in it failed.Tried a new cord, running diagnostics, etc.Now it's too late to return.Do not recommend wasting your money on this."
116,1,Broke a little over 6 months of use without a drop or accident,Broke a day before my Finals with all my data and VMs on it. I would not recommend this product as it is not reliable.
117,2,Drive is good while it lasts,"Bought several of these it works good while it lasts. However warranty is not anywhere near sufficient. BEWARE you get warranty and the ""Rescue"" feature for only 1 year (!), so my drive would not boot up on connection and makes strange noises 15 months after purchase. Essentially all data on it is GONE - you would have to buy 2 of them so that you make a ""backup of a backup"" and not loose your data."
118,1,Don't trust as only backup!!!,After 5 months drive stopped working.Just started making a humming noise.Lost all my data!!
119,5,Producto de Calidad y fiabilidad,El producto llegó en tiempo perfecto y con los requerimientos de cuidados necesarios. Se recomienda al vendedor cien porciento
120,5,Much need storage space for Backups.,This works great for backup purposes.Not the fastest but hey it's 10TB!I had some problems when the PC went to sleep with it recognizing it when the PC wakes up.My backups run early in the a.m. (2-3 am) so I attribute that to maybe the drive being slow to wakeup and come online.Not sure.I've had this for a while and works great.Always had Seagate drives and find them very reliable.
121,2,"NOT ""Plug'n Play""","Very long, time consuming story made short is that this drive came with nothing built in to it to enable me to simply plug it into my laptop and make it work.I have no formal computer training whatsoever and all I wanted to do was back-up my files in case of the laptop crashing.Many frustrating hours of youtube tutorialsand phone calls before I could get my computer to recognize it.Don't say I didn't warn you."
122,5,Works like a champ!,I connected this Seagate Portable to my Tablo Digital Video Recorder and it worked first time with no problems since.
123,5,Just what I needed,Purchased to expand my Dex environment. Just what I needed to ditch an old school desktop
124,5,it works,as expected
125,5,Easy to set up,Love it used it for my ps4 just took a long time to get it
126,1,Can’t get it to format for Mac even though it says it will work on a Mac.,Won’t format for Mac.
127,4,good capacity but still sdd life & external speed,"perhaps it’s the older mac os, this does not provide a smooth TimeMachine restore from a dead HDD"
128,5,Great value great hd,Affordable easy too use plug n playreliable
129,1,Not compatible with ps5 I transferred 2k23 and it deleted my game I had to re-copy.,Not compatible with ps5 I transferred 2k23 and it deleted my game I had to re-copy.
130,5,Good job,good for a computer's job
131,1,not good,could not get it to work on my new desktop computer Windows 11 also would not work on my laptop or iPad 4 thumbs down.
132,5,Exactly what we wanted,Works perfectly and is exactly what we needed
133,5,"Simple and easy to use to transfer or store files, videos, or photos!","I bought a new computer and needed to transfer data. On a Mac, I didn't have to download any software or do anything special. The process was simple and intuitive for this GenXer! Great price for a substantial amount of storage. I would 10/10 buy again!"
134,1,It lasted 2 weeks,I left it plugged into my Windows 10 computer.I couldn't get my computer to boot.I unplugged the Seagate USB drive and the computer could boot up.I could not see the drive in explorer or disk management.Tried multiple USB ports and another computer.
135,5,Everything you need,You get what you pay for
136,1,Failed after 4 months,It failed after 4 months of use. I contacted tech support and they told me I should back up to online. To me that’s too short of a life span for a usb at this cost & unreliable for my job.
137,5,Very useful,I keep this connected to my computer and store all files on it.
138,5,Does what it is made to do.,"Once I formatted it NTFS (it was formatted extFAT) and told Disk Management to open the drive, Windows 11 saw the drive.Current standard for counting bytes is still a lie (drive is really 14.5Tb, not 16Tb).All in all a great deal!"
139,1,This device is terrible 1 star,Broke within hours of first use
140,5,Great price,Easy to use and a great price
141,5,Crashed,"Took a year and a half. But it won't repair itself, won't let me load content from it and won't wipe clean to use it again. Was using it to store PS4 games as an external. Doesn't vibrate from fan movement. Light comes on but nobody home."
142,5,Great storage,The media could not be loaded. Great additional game storage. Save some time copying instead of re downloading. Plus Seagate is a great brand. If you are using this for a PS5 you need to plug it into the back usb port of the console.
143,5,Works great!,Added needed storage for PS4!
144,5,Great external drive.,Great external drive.
145,1,DOA - Returened for a refund,"The hard drive I received wont power on.I didn't take the time to test weather the problem was with the cord or the HHD case, before deciding to send it back.Also the USB 3.0 Plug on the side was constructed a cheaply as I have ever seen.I had to gently work with it for several minuets just to plug the USB cable into the drive casing.I hate to give bad reviews but this time I just received a box of disappointment."
146,1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am now past my return window and this piece of junk stopped working with all of my drone footage on there. I should have paid attention to the reviews. My loss, doesn't have to be yours. Save your money and time and buy elsewhere from a better company."
147,5,Works as promised,I have a variety of 2.5 and 3.5 HHD anywhere from 500GB to 4 TB that were sitting collecting dust after upgrading to SSD.This enclosure is a great tool to allow me to clone / copy / backup all the upgrades with ease.A simple swap of the drive type and I now have a sturdy USB compatible with every device I have.Also use to store system images for fast recovery.Nice product if you want to repurpose any HHD you have.
148,1,Crashes PS4.,Not good. Constantly crashing my PS4.
149,1,Do Not Buy This Product!They want too much personal information,I want an external hard drive and not to be asked personal questions about what I want to do with it.It should be easy to use but I'm going to throw it away.There's no privacy with this product on your computer.
150,3,Difficulties with large files,"I like the storage capacity and price of this external hard drive, but it has difficulty reading large files. I think this is a limitation of it being only USB powered. It works well for smaller files, but it is sometimes completely unable to open large PDFs (books)."
151,5,Excellent.,I'm happy with how it works.
152,1,it's the worst,it doesn't work
153,4,"If using with a Mac/USB-C, you will need an adapter","Received this on time and as described.A little disappointed the connection to the drive itself is proprietary (not USB-A or USB-C), so had to order an adapter to connect to my 2016 MacBook Pro."
154,1,Either used or box open. Returning it.,Why did this hard drive not come with any box packing from seagate?? The plastic box is not sealed as well. The outer cardboard box does not have anything mentioned of seagate anywhere. Going to return this. Feels like used or box open piece when I paid for new.
155,5,Great Storage for Backup Game ROMS,Great Storage for Backup Game ROMS - especially full libraries of CD based retro consoles. Also massive storage in general with the portable 5 terabytes.
156,1,Don’t waste your money!,"This is a horrible product and not worth the money. I would never buy this again and had I known it would stop working in less than 3 months I would have never bought it at all. For the price of this product it was not worth the time it worked. Save your money, Don’t buy!"
157,5,Excelente equipo,Buen equipo
158,5,"I use it for daily backup, so far works flawless","I use it to have an offline backup of my NAS, so far 14TB is large enough though sooner or later I'd need a bigger one. The backup is like time machine so I can go back several months in time.It runs a backup every day, and it's been exactly 1 year, it's about 70% full now..."
159,5,Nothing its good as far as i know,So far so good Its been about a year.
160,4,Works as needed,Works great try not to juggle it around if taking it places. But very portable and handy. Storage is perfect
161,5,Perfect,External hard drive is perfect in every way.Couldn't be happier.
162,5,Great,Great
163,5,So far. so good!,The 18 terabyte storage capacity was quickly recognized by my desktop HP computer.Both ports seem to work well.It will work well for integrating my data stored across multiple computers.
164,1,Not Compatible With Mac,Unless you want to download and partition with non Mac system....don't buy this.
165,2,Not 4tb only 3.63TB available,Not sure why it has so much memory not available? Maybe I’m reading it wrong but seams like its not a full 4tb. It seams to move files over fast though.
166,1,Trash !,This product is trash and I just lost a ton of backed up data that’s going to cost me $600-$1900 IF it can even be recovered DO NOT BUY ! I’ve only had it since August
167,1,Dead on Arrival,Would not power on.
168,5,Dose What It Does,It's an external hard drive made by the leading brand for them. It does what they say it does. No complaints. it cool :)
169,5,Works great,This is a great cost effective way to store more files. It’s easy to use and not heavy or bulky.
170,5,"Huge, fast, affordable","I backed up everything I own, multiple huge hard drives, all onto this one drive. I was extremely pleased with the speed, quietness and design.Best backup drive I have owned, and everything went so smoothly that I have full confidence in having all my data backed up in a safe place."
171,4,Second Time Was a Charm,Bought this to offload my library of games and apps to an external storage device. First drive came and was dead on arrival. Xbox One wouldn’t detect it and my Linux computer reported drive read errors. It was quickly replaced by Amazon and the second drive has had no errors so far. Xbox One detected it right away. It’s been transferring games from internal storage to external storage at about 500Mbps.
172,3,NOT 16 TB Despite listing,First thing I noticed was that as soon as you boot it up you find out that it's only 14.5TB.That's 10% less than what I thought I was buying.I expect some loss of product as most drives have that.I don't expect to get a full Terabyte and a half less than what I paid for.
173,1,Keeps disconnecting,The hard drive keeps disconnecting endlessly from my computer.
174,5,Excellent,I am very happy with this product
175,5,Full of storage,Used it to move some of my p4 games over & it was very easy to get done
176,1,Stopped working suddenly. No drives on website.,Stopped working. Don't know why.
177,5,Plug & Play... Literally!,Extremely simple to use and very compact and light. Great value!
178,5,This has lasted so long,Is what it says it is but it’s just 999.99 gbs not a whole tb and I’m MAD
179,2,"Lasted less than a year, never made it past 30% space and crashed","Stored indoors, used every couple of days within reason. Never dropped or damaged, drive went bad out of no where. Will not purchase again."
180,1,Absolute garbage!,"This thing didn't even last two months. I put data on this thing, a total of six times. It has about 3 tb left and it will not turn on. I bought a new cable and I've tried connecting it to an acer, an hp, and my regular tower pc. Nothing. No light, no sound, nothing. I'm glad I was only using this for backup and not my main storage. Don't buy this trash. Save your money and get a regular hard drive or an ssd"
181,1,Do NOT buy!,"I have had this all of 2 months and it is an absolute nightmare. I've lost EVERYTHING that was stored on it. It was working okay one minute, the next it's completely freezing my computer. Unplug the drive and The computer works fine. Plug it back in and it freezes everything again. Can't even format it because it freezes everything while plugged inSo unless you want to pay hundreds for data recovery or just losing everything, don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!!!!Also The cord that comes with it is poorly made and only designed for this hard drive, it doesn't take any other cords.Which means if the cord goes out, which it does very quickly, the only option is to buy another one of their cords. Run far away from it!!!"
182,1,Defective,After reading the reviews and thought it would be OK. I bought the 4tb. Little did I know it was a $99 humming box. I originally bought it for my pa4 but after not being able to see the device I tried my Xbox 1. Didnt even show up. Maybe its just my systems so I tried my computer in every usb port. Absolutely nothing!!!
183,1,Not recommended,"Barely lasted 6 months. No warning, just stopped working one morning. Another one went from being usable one second to not working the next."
184,2,Gave up after maybe 10 months of use,Worked pretty decent up until a little bit ago the hard drive itself took a dump sucks because it's just under 10 months old
185,1,Plugin broke and cannot access files,The drive was working great until a piece of the plugin broke off and now I have to hold the chord a specific way to get my files off the drive and sometimes that does not work.
186,5,Very Necessary,This is my 3rd external hard drive.Very relieved to once again have a ton of space to work with. 😏👍
187,5,StorageCapacity,Great with grandsons xbox one
188,5,Great,Works as expected
189,1,"""Read Only"" permissions, can't copy files anywhere else!","This drive save the files with ""Read only"" permissions by default and doesn't allow to change them, so I have all those files I copied locked in them, unable to copy them to another device as I wanted. Terrible! I don't recommend this at all."
190,3,Im confused,"So I really liked it once I had my new computer but for some reason in my Apple MacBook it won’t work which is inconvenient, however now that I already have it I’ll use it in the other computer (Lenovo)"
191,5,great!,works like it’s supposed too & comes with a wire to plug in X1
192,5,..,. North
193,5,Seagate portable external drive,"Using this to pictures , ICloud is full.Great to have !"
194,1,Stop working,After only 1 month stopped working with the Xbox..the heads stopped spinning and led to a beebing sound...so not impressed
195,5,It did what it was supposed to do,It got the job done and continues to do the job required. Have not had any problems with it overall a good device.
196,5,Utter Perfection,"Came in perfect condition, as described. Had all the storage I could ever need or want on it. I got 1 tb each for my computer and Xbox. Both are working great, easy to format and move games to. I love this product."
197,1,had for 4 months and died,"I got this to store my schoolwork on. I had for 4 months, and it died. Started beeping. I troubleshot it, and it's an internal problem. Waste of money. And lost my work. Thanks (NOT!) This is why I always back things up in more than once place."
198,5,Plug and play simplicity,I like the fact it is so easy to use. Just plug it in and follow the prompts.
199,5,I absolutely love this,Love this storage this provides for me to download for sims game
200,5,Just what I needed space,Love the extra space
201,4,A little slow,Speeds could be a little faster
202,5,Awesome,The storage capacity is great
203,5,Doesn't connect directly to ps5 with supplied cable's as described,Doesn't connect to ps5 as described
204,5,Great buy,Worked great and easy to take on the go. Have had no problems with it.
205,5,Good size,but gets hot and a bit slow.Latency?
206,5,"Travel safe, durable, great for gift!",Awesome and user friendly. Giftable item!
207,5,"Great back up, used on a Mac","Comes with easy instructions to format to a Mac, it comes formatted for Windows. It's pretty quick and has a ton of storage. These are so inexpensive that I use them to back up my main external hard drive. Haven't had any problems, came quick and packaged well."
208,1,Second Seagate Expansion HD Failure,"The media could not be loaded. I bought a Seagate external HD a few years back and it failed after a couple years so I thought I just got unlucky.Just because of availability I got a second Seagate external HD last black Friday and this one failed in less than a year.From day one it was already noisy but I didn't think much of it.Now it just has problems accessing any data on the drive and makes very loud ""crunching"" sounds every time it's trying to retrieve data.Needless to say, I already lost a bunch of data on the drive and will try to recover whatever is left.To make matters worse, I also bought an internal Seagate HD on the same day and it is also making loud disk accessing noises since day one.It hasn't failed yet but this leads me to think there is some manufacturing problem with their hard drives.Now I know why Seagate was available and my first option(Western Digital) wasn't last year."
209,5,Good,Good
210,1,Defective,Defective
211,5,Easy peasy,Computer backup
212,5,Perfect,Great device!
213,5,I Almost Returned It,"Gift from my Brother and may only help a few but here goes. My main pc runs on Ubuntu Linux. The drive arrived and I plugged it in. Computer found it right away no problem. I copied hundreds of videos from my Youtube channel directory over for backup. Slow but no problem. In the morning I tried to copy over 2 video files totaling 3 gig, My computer froze. That never happens. Unplugged drive and all was good. Tried again, just 2 files and pc froze again. I'm thinking, I may have to return it. Last effort I formatted drive with ext4 file system not NTFS. Backed up hundreds of files again. Working fine! Not slow. Not freezing. It's only been a day but will update if needed."
214,5,fast and reliable,plug and playgreat for backing up your files
215,5,Needs both USB power and A/C power,"Another reviewer said that the drive did not work with the power adapter that has no holes in the prongs.This is not true.You can use either the adapter with holes in the prongs or no holes in the prongs.The drive will not power-on, though, unless you have both the A/C adapter and the USB cable plugged in. Although, the internal Hard drive drive supports SATA3, it runs at SATA2 speeds (according to CrystalDiskInfo), and connects via USB 3.0 (a.k.a USB 3.1 gen 1), Otherwise, the drive works fine. Being Seagate, we'll have to wait to see how long it lasts."
216,5,Perfect in every way,This thing has more than enough storage than I needed. I used it for my PlayStation 4 pro and it was just plug in and that was it. 10/10
217,2,Doesn’t work for Mac OS,This is my second one I’ve purchased. The item explicitly states it will work for Mac OS - nope. Don’t waste your time. Windows it works fine but I have no use for two windows ones.
218,5,Compact storage!,"Well, if you have ever had your computer crash and lose files then you know the headache (and heartache).I finally decided to buy something that would save my files, as I had to purchase a new computer.I saw this and got very excited.The price was reasonable and it arrived quickly.I was happy to be able to get my pictures and important files stored.Directions to use are easy and if you have any questions there is tech support.I don't see how anyone can go wrong purchasing this external hard drive.Also, plenty of storage space for my needs.Good purchase!"
219,1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I have only had this product for 3.5 months and this harddrive has DIED. I've lost all of my important documents and precious family photos from my honeymoon, all wedding anniversaries, loved ones who are nolonger here...ALL GONE.TOOK IT TO A SPECIALIST TO RECOVER MY DATA THEY BASICALLY SAID NEVER BUY THIS TYPE OF HARD DRIVE AND THIS IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP THAT HE DOESN'T ADVISE HIS CLIENTS TO GET.EVERYTHING IS GONE AND I JUST GOT THIS HARDDRIVE."
220,1,Click chirp click,"Hasn't failed yet, but does a LOT of very loud clicking and chirping as if failure is imminent. This has been. since day one. Not using for anything important until I open a case with Seagate."
221,5,Works perfect with ps4,No issues
222,1,Extremely slow.,Very disappointed! I had a WD 5 TB Passport on my computer. I replaced it with the Seagate using the same USB port. The Seagate is MANY times slower. It is useless.I tried both the Seagate software and simple xcopy in a bat file and it is terrible.
223,3,Slow slslow sslow,I have an arrknload of these drives and this one mist be 2.0. Would avoid
224,4,Computer backup,"I like the Seagate reputation, for use of computer backup"
225,5,Very good product,Works perfect for my ps4
226,5,How I got it to work on my mac (finally)...,"I bought this drive (10TB version) to use as a media storage device for my Plex server. I run my Plex server on an older (2013) apple iMac that is running MacOS Catalina. When I first unboxed the drive, it looked nice, but when I plugged it into the power and then the USB on the back of my computer, it wouldn't show up.I couldn't get it to show up in my Finder window, on my desktop, or even in Disk Utility.I did all the tricks to show all drives and all volumes, but it just didn't even recognize that it was plugged in at all.I read some of the other reviews, lots of people complaining about how it wouldn't work on their mac etc..., I thought that maybe I was going to have to return the drive and figure out something else (it comes preformatted in exFAT, but as I said, MacOS Catalina wouldn't even acknowledge it was plugged in at all, so there was no way for me to reformat into the the system I wanted).Luckily I had a Mac Laptop with BigSur installed.On my laptop, it didn't show up in Finder or the desktop at first, but it did recognize it in Disk Utility (again, you have to set it to show all drives and volumes in the view).There I was able to select it, then reformat it as MacOS Journaled (or whatever file system you wanted, but that is what I use on my older Mac).Once I did that, I was able to plug it into my older Mac, and it showed up in Finder, Desktop, and Disk Utility.I actually reformatted again on the old mac (just to be safe, but probably not really needed as it was reading, I just wanted to make sure it would work on the old mac the way I wanted it to).As I'm typing this, it's just finishing backing up the 4TB of media from my old drive, it's been whirring away for about 24 hours now, no problems so far.So as long as you are willing (and have the newer macOS available), then this is a great external hard drive for Macs, just don't expect it to work natively right out of the box (but external hard drives rarely do).That being said, I am happy with the price and performance so far, hoping 10TB will last me quite a while (my old drive was 6TB and I thought I would never even come close to filling that up, but I don't like to run my drives too full, so using 4TB out of 6TB was more than I liked, so this 10TB should fit the bill nicely for a while anyway)."
227,5,Fantastic Storage Drive.,This is one of the Best Drives for backing up files and for Storage .One of the best I've seen.I'm going to buy more later on. I wish the price would come down some for the 4 TB and 6 TB and TBsAwesome Device.Stick with the Named Brands and Stay AWAY from Off Brandsl
228,5,No serious issues thus far,"Nice and conveniently small. I bought this months ago and I paired it with my Mac but it took extra steps to make it readable, and I've had to do it twice for some reason, but I don't really understand tech. So I recommend."
229,5,Love this product,I like how. Slim this is. Does not take up. A lot of room. U can. Place it anywereand will not take up a lot of roomworks very well and as describedI will be buying more. Of the product but. Most likely bigger for internal
230,5,Great product,"Works just awesome, perfect place to store all my things."
231,5,works as intended,"works well, when use with ps5, it can be a little loose and unplug, and then it will make me repair the drive, though probably not a fault with the hard drive itself."
232,5,Justo lo que buscaba,Entrega rápida
233,2,It stopped working after a year.,This hard stopped working after a year
234,5,Great product,Got this external storage for my ps5 and it worked perfectly.. simple to use and set up. overall great product and would buy again.
235,4,Decent,"Not bad, you just can't play the games on it without having to transfer them first."
236,5,Perfect,"It’s flawless, nothing wrong with it at all"
237,5,Doing it job!,I use this to backup files
238,2,More than Industry Shrink on Size,"I looked into the hub but encryption doesn't unlock without desktop software when above 12tb. The ports according to the Seagate representative do not aid in bringing in outside data. He stated it was for microphones headphones keyboard mouse etc... If it does actually do data contrary to what he says I suspect it must go in the pc for the processor to handle and back to the hub. This I suspect would be slower than giving two hdds their own port at the pc. If it went straight to the hub, the hub would have to have extra processing power/internal hardware and software and at that point you would be limited on how you can manage the hdd.l as it would be more than a hdd.What really hacks me off is they shorted the storage more than the expected industry standard. a terabyte or gigabyte it is 1024 parts so when a company ships a gigabyte they actually ship 1000 mb which is not a full gigabyte of 1024mb. every bit of storage is a fraction of what they claim. what has me angry with seagate is they didn't even sell a full 18tb by the unethical standards of a base 10 number system. The industry standard was unethical though it was an understood a norm, but the current shorting in size is almost class actuon lawsuit worthy as it was less than the 1000 for every gb/tb.on the whole I hate that they constantly change shells and styles and their software is more gimmick than useful. None came with this. Paid for the regular desktop hdd to get an extra 2tb at a similar pricepoint and ultimately still got 16tb and not 18tb. I think I read a review where the hub was an actual 18tb so lool for that but I can not confirm as I dont have the hub... I fear the day they sell hdds with their software beyond basic functionality integrated. I hate when extra services are offered in all technology that I can't choose to install and they force it on you. Yhe worse in thay regard is their recovery services. I wouldn't trust a 3rd party and I would have concern if it creates a hackable backdoor. Extra garbage, extra risk. On the whole, unless unlucky their hdds have been good. I'm livid about them selling a 16tb hdd as an 18tb. It's criminal and they couldn't even do 18 tb as data actually used in a base 10 number system.18tb is really a 16.3tb"
239,1,very delicate,Tipped over on my desk and quit working.
240,5,Great External Hardrive,Great extra storage. I purchased to store my games and it has worked flawlessly!
241,5,I liked,"Good quality, working well, recommended"
242,5,good,I like it
243,5,As described,Good product. works great. Easy setup. A+++
244,5,It is a Christmas gift,Can not rate because it is a Christmas gift
245,1,Extremely Loud,Would not recommend this hard drive. It is extremely noisy and aggravating having near the computer.
246,5,Great storage,Very useful. Plenty of space. 10/10
247,5,Great item,Got this for storage for my computer pair photos great item
248,1,Do not buy this if you are using MAC.,Do not buy this if you are using MAC. It asks that you REDUCE security to enable its use
249,1,Rip off,"Plugged no auto install, no Seagate menu as per directions paper. Reads as only 465GB. Not even half a single TB. Did all tech support directions,tech chat was zero help just sending me same page already at. Returning and expect a very quick refund. This was ridiculous. I did several formatting setting to NFST and did not change the 465GB."
250,5,Great product,"Purchased this to replace a 2TB external HD on my PS4.I connect this to the PS4 and let it format the drive.Before I could download existing game to the new 8TB HD, I had to delete the game on the 2TB first."
251,5,Exactly as pictured,Took it to my neighbor who backed up my system in just a few minutes
252,5,Great storage for video games,I used this on my 1TB PlayStation and it works great!
253,1,Product dysfunction,"This 16 TB Seagate drive was connected to a MAC desk top computer.Periodically, the drive became inaccessible. I spoke with the Seagate technical support team about this problem twice. They identified the problem as unexplained drive ""unmounting."" Despite their thorough investations, the problem persisted. I have removed all information from the drive and discarded. it."
254,1,Doesn’t work,"Tried it on my ps5, series x, and ps4 and it still won’t work. It lights up but that’s it. Doesn’t try to format"
255,4,Perfect for your mother who saves too many pics,"Bought it for my mom who saves a TON of pictures. If I didn't buy it, I'm pretty sure her computer was going to explode"
256,5,The unit works as advertised.,At this time since I really just received the unit I will reserve comment on the long term use.
257,3,The 14TB is by far the loudest hard drive I've ever purchased.,"No matter if it's in vertical or horizontal orientation, and no matter if it's connected directly to my laptop or via a powered hub, this this makes periodic terrible noises that make me feel like it's going to fail at any moment.I've owned a bunch of Seagate 5TB, 8TB and 10TB drives in the same line and they've never behaved like this.Speed is slow but that's what you expect with a drive like this.I just wasn't expecting so much troubling drive noise."
258,5,Great Product,I needed extra storage for my photos and this was extremely useful
259,1,NEVER WORKED RIGHT,I always purchase Seagate never had a problem this one is a lemon.I can get items on the drive then the drive closes.Seems faulty.
260,1,stopped working 2 weeks after I bought it,keeps making a beeping noise started 2 weeks after a I bought it tried everything to fix it still wont work
261,5,Easy way to add more space to your electronics!,"I got this for my teenage son so he would be able to add more space to his laptop.It is easy to connect and portable, so he can pack it up in his laptop case and take it with him wherever he goes."
262,5,Works perfect,Seems to work fine
263,3,You can’t switch this device from a Mac to a windows,"I was working on my Mac for a long time but just got a windows so I plugged it in and it will not recognize my device no matter what I do, basically from reviews I watched on YouTube you have to delete everything on the drive to get it on a new computer, but I thought the point of a hard drive was to carry all the projects with you and plug in to any computer but no"
264,5,"Perfect for Backup and Extra storage for Photos, pics etc.","I love these Seagate drives.I have 3 - 2TB drives and this one.Haven't experienced any problems with them and they work perfectly with the Toolkit and Norton backup applications.This 5TB portable drive is perfect for moving my data, photos, pics, etc to other computers when upgrading those devices.Just plug and play and your done.Good hardware!"
265,5,Good buy,Very useful. Glad I bought it
266,5,im about to buy another one!,"if I could give this 6 stars you best believe I would. when I say this hard drive is amazing I mean it, this product is small smooth and durable, and easy to set up. when I first got this I was in need of storage badly, I only had 5 games on my Xbox and just a bunch of uninstalled games laying around, I now have 62 games installed on this hard drive with 1 TB left of storage! the hard drive is small enough to hang next to your Xbox if you have a wall mount of course, and if you do not like the look of the hard drive next to it, it is small enough to fit behind your Xbox. the hard drive is durable as well, dropped it multiple times and not a scratch. lose your cord? easy it's compatible with multiple cords!i really enjoy this product and would recommend"
267,1,Crashed the second time I used this,Very disappointed that I uploaded pictures on this drive twice and it crashed. Now I have to send it in to HOPES that my pictures are saved. I'm so upset. I wish I could get my money back. Should have stayed with the flash drives
268,1,Broke and lost my data.,In the middle of transferring data the hard drive malfunctioned and lost all the data I transferred to it. I tried reformatting so I could at least try to use it again but it wouldn’t read the disk anymore. Returned and got my money back.
269,1,NOT worth the headache,"Follow the advice of other reviewers, drive NOT reliable. Purchased drive May '22, used as Time Machine backup drive. Notice periodically backups weren't happening, drive would ""disappear"". Used Disk Utility to repair and even erased to ensure better performance. Until it happened again and again. Tried TechTool Pro to diagnose, couldn't repair, mount or erase at this point. Here it is Nov '22 less than 6 months after purchase. CANNOT recommend this drive. Gone back to WD."
270,1,"Was not compatible, Returned and still getting charged for item.",This product was returned immediately. I should not be charged!
271,4,"Great deal, my son was so happy to be able to download and store more games.","Good price , good quality and does what it's suppose to. Couldn't ask for more."
272,5,Bought to warehouse video,We bought this to warehouse all of our Just for fans and Only fans videos. It’s our archive file.It’s easy to use.Sets up fast.Compatible with most computersYes worth the money. We store ALL of our Xx stuff on it. It’s a good hard drive
273,4,Works as intended.,Works as intended so far. Fairly quick transfer speeds. I don't regret buying it.
274,1,Third Seagate that failed this year.,"I used Seagate drives for years but recently they've been a disaster for me.Product support tells me that it's something mechanical in the drive so I should return it to them.But, all my professional patient data and personal data is on that drive, which I can no longer access to erase.They say they'll erase it but I can't trust that.I have too much liability for the $50 cost of the drive.So, I'll just destroy it as I did with the last two. I will switch to a new type of backup external drive."
275,3,"Nice size, but it runs hot!","I have several external hard drives to catalog the over 4500 CD's I have in my collection.I also have a large Photo collection that requires several TB to back-up.So, I purchased the Seagate 10 TB Expansion to not only back up my CD files, but to also back-up documents and anything else that needed backed up.I also have a program that I can go to to check my hard drives to make sure they're functioning properly.What I found rather quickly that the Expansion would heat up to a critical point just sitting there, without me adding anything to it.My other drives were okay; just the Expansion would get up to 50 C which set off alarms in my software.I have tried everything to keep it cooled down, even placing a fan directly over it that remains on constantly.Still, it heats up.My only solution is to get my work completed quickly and disconnect it to keep it from being damaged.Why does it heat up when my other three externals do not?Maybe I don't understand external hard drives, but my other Seagate, as well as my two WD's do not seem to have the problem."
276,5,Love it,Light weight and fast
277,5,Holds up to 40 games,Works well. More games are easy to scroll thru and play now .
278,5,Great little drive,"I use them both on Macs and PCs as video and backup storage. Great capacity, small space, makes no noise."
279,1,Don't buy,Read Write speeds 1/2 of advertised which was already slow enough. Not worth it even at that low price.
280,1,Failed shortly after warranty interval was over,"This portable hard drive worked fine for the duration of the warranty period but threw in the towel a few months afterward. For $60, I would expect a somewhat longer service life."
281,5,Vino dañado,Vino dañado no sube y tiene un sonido cómo un pito
282,3,Great but it MELTED,"Lightweight and sleek, never had any issues and seems reliable so far. I've had this les than a year - my MacBook has no freaking storage so ALL of my photos and documents and work items are on this. Cord melted into the hard drive last night ad burned and melted the cabe. Not sure if I can recover anything now and stressing out. Could have started a fire or damaged my laptop."
283,5,Perfect for gamers looking to upgrade from 500GB,"I used to use a Seagate Portable External Hardrive for an Xbox that had run out of storage. It was perfect for my needs then, and it is perfect for my needs now that I own a laptop with a 500GB storage cap. I am able to play whatever game I wish to without worrying about storage space... Just as intended!"
284,1,Defective and not authorized seller per Seagate,"Bought 3. None worked. After over 1 hr on chat and phone with Seagate, determined all 3 disks do not work and that Nationwide Tech Biz is not an authorized Seagate seller. Also, these should have had 1 yr warranties and only have 3 month warranties. Do not order these!"
285,1,it stops working in less than 7 months,it stops working in less than 7 months.Do not buy it.
286,1,BREAKS EASILY!!!,"I bought this drive with high hopes. It had 1tb of storage and seemed to work well with larger steam games. (Apex, Ark, Horizon zero dawn, rdr2 & rdo) I have plugged in the device to my gaming laptop maybe 3 times, just to download the games and then play them for an hour or two. I eventually got bored and didnt use the drive for a couple of weeks. I plugged it in yesterday in attempt to play a game and suddenly the driver itself is making a weird patterned noise, my laptop wont recognize the driver when it's plugged in, and my games wont show up.NEVER BUY SEAGATE!"
287,5,Shirt downloads,Works great for the job l need it for. Thank you
288,5,Great product,"Portable, easy to use, value for money"
289,1,Truly a terrible product,"This brand new drive does not work at all. It is so slow, and after loading it with just 100GB of data, it doesn't even show up when I plug it into the computer. Do not waste your money on this complete piece of garbage."
290,5,Perfect,Exactly what I wanted and works beautifully. Couldn't be happier. Definitely buy this for yourself cuz you won't regret it.
291,4,Good deal for the price. Needs a USB 3.0,It works. Nothing super special but a good deal for the cost. Make sure you have a USB 3.0 though. Will not work with a 2.0 connection.
292,5,Slight issue but best SSD on the market,"I bought the 5TB drive and when I plugged it into my computer it had only shown roughly 500GB. I've never encountered this problem before using SSDs but after a little search in properties I figured out the format was set to FAT instead of NTFS, so after I reformatted then it showed 4.54TB (binary value) thankfully.It wasn't too much of an issue but other than that this SSD is amazing and super fast, easily portable, and you just can't go wrong with it."
293,1,Product never worked,I purchased this product and it never worked
294,1,Could not mount on Computer,The drive is not mounting on my laptop or two of the desktops.Can’t see it on the desktop.It is frustrating as I use to it to carry my files to work.
295,5,Worked Great,"Worked great, very easy to use, great value I got this for my new PS5 for storage and I haven't had any issues at all it was perfect"
296,1,THIS IS NOT A 4 TB drive,Advertisement clearly states 4 TB drive.You can see my hard drive is almost full (red line) which is why I bought this. As soon as it's plugged in and recognized it shows 3.63 TB available on 3.63 TB drive. I struggled to buy this in the first place as my previous 2 TB Seagate backup drive no longer words after only a year and 1/2. We'll never buy another Seagate product
297,5,Exactly what I needed!,exactly what I needed. Be sure to reformat The new just drive to work cohesively with your operating system.
298,5,Bought as a workaround to a bug in windows.,There's a bug in windows with the store and Xbox ultimate pass where if you have anything but NTFS as your file system you can't use the drive for games even if selected. I have a drive that's NTFS however it won't let me use it. I bought this formatted it and it's working flawlessly.I am out of SATA ports so this drive had to be the solution. If my budget would have been higher I would have bought a bigger drive. Love the drive anyway for the solution it provided me. Would recommend this drive for any external solution regardless of how you use it. Mine is a niche case scenario.
299,5,Great for extra game storage,"I use a 1 TB system hard drive on my console and with all the games, updates, and more I just don't have the space. So I'll just keep deleting and downloading games and it was time-consuming. Since getting this external hard drive I've gotten to keep all my games"
300,3,About 730GB short,I ordered the 8TB and it only has 7.27TB of storage.Seriously how do you deliver a product that is 730GB short of what is advertised?Wack.
301,5,Good,Easy to use
302,5,It's worth the cash.,Didn't know it was powered by a wall outlet in order to run haha!Fast file transfer rate and does what it its made to do.
303,2,Lost all the data I had stored,"I lost all my data as soon as the warranty was up. I din't think they planned for that to happen that way, it just did."
304,1,Failed after 2 months,Extremely disappointed. Second seagate drive to go down within a few months of purchasing.Customer service was terrible and I lost 8 Terabytes of data. I will never purchase another seagate again
305,5,Great Space,Purchased this for my PS5 and it works great.
306,1,Not worth the price,This product is not a 4T product I connect it to my computer and it shows a 3.63T
307,1,This unit did not last very long and started causing problems with my computer,This unit did not last very long and started causing problems with my computer.My computer wouldn't boot up with it attached and it started making all kinds of noises when I was trying to use it.
308,1,Stopped working,I purchased this item back in July it was working fine. Now when I try to use it it makes a noise and also it can’t be found on my computer. It makes the sound like it is plugged up but it doesn’t show. I’m afraid I have lost all my business work and important documents because of this faulty issue. I will never put all my important information on a hard drive again.
309,5,good buy,works prefect holds everything that im doing
310,5,Good,Good
311,2,Died Less Than Two Years After Purchase,"I used it as a Time Machine backup for my Mac and it worked beautifully....until 21 months after purchase. It stopped backing up. Can't be found in Finder. I tried every imaginable fix. And the warranty expired more than a year ago. I was happy, until I wasn't."
312,5,Works as advertised,Works as advertised.
313,2,Worked great until it didn't anymore,"I have a couple different 1-2tb external usb hard drives I use for backing up files, this is the one I bought most recently and its also the only one with consistent issues. Worked perfect for a few months but recently it isn't recognized at boot and frequently requires me to unplug and plug it back in to access."
314,1,Does NOT work with MAC,If you need for a Mac computer- Do NOT use. Only works for PC.
315,5,Works great,Works great for my ps5 love it
316,1,Blew up after 14 months,"Worked fine, then all of a sudden it no longer shows > 50% of the data items on it."
317,5,Seems great,"It seems like its good and strong, but the funny thing about hard drives is, sometimes they die a month later.For now its excellent and a good value.If that changes, I'll update this review!"
318,5,I love it!,I have now purchased two of these. And every time I have been nothing but pleased. The first was for my PS4 and the second for the PS5. Both times we just plugged them in and they were formatted by the PlayStation systems. They were good to go! Super easy to move back and forth from the consoles as well!
319,5,Works Perfectly - Perfect Out of the Box,"Seagate Portable 1TB External Hard Drive HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac... I have a Mac computer. I bought this drive to use as a Time Machinebackup for my computer.I dont know if I needed to re-format the drive but that is the very first thing I did. Using Mac Disk Utility, I re-formatted the drive 100% into Mac protocols.The drive has worked perfectly from Day-1 right out of the box and has given me no reason for complaint.Yes... I would buy it again although I would probably opt in for a much larger drive."
320,2,Its Beeping for some reason.,It is beeping and it wont work can someone help?
321,5,Gift,She liked it it does what it was supposed to do
322,1,Not worth it. Spend the extra money on the ssd,Used it for my xbox and it died after a month.
323,5,Very nice,"I needed more space for my files, it’s great. I checked the actual memory it allows me to store and from 20 GB it gives me 18 GB stock. I guess 2 GB are taken but it’s own software? It’s very nice, easy to install basically Plug and Play and I was ready to go."
324,5,Great for the price,This worked perfectly right out of the box with my Dish Wally receiver. It turns the receiver into a fully functional DVR.
325,5,Excellent Hard drive,Great product.Seamless integration.Exactly what I was looking for.I highly recommend it.
326,5,Perfect,Personal
327,3,Works until it’s disturbed,"Worked well for a while, but accidentally bumped it and now it makes a weird beeping sound and isn’t recognized by my Xbox. Super fragile I guess."
328,2,Keep saying it had no space!!,So I got it with 2TB because I need more storage for Sims4 on my PC but I can’t move anything to drive and it keep telling me it had no space when you can see it had not been use and had ton of space.
329,1,Did not last long,"Purchased May 2020 and it died Novemmer 2022. I did not even use it on a daily basis. The ""drivein use/connection"" idicator stopped iluminating.Tested it on other USB portsand on other computers and it did not recognize the drive."
330,1,Stopped Working in Less Than a Month,"I purchased this drive to store some photos on. We did not take this on walks or attempt to use its portable features -- only purchased the portable version for the durability...In less than a month we started to hear it beeping, and looked this up to discover that our read/write head had become stuck on the platter. At this point, we will need to take to a data recovery center to retrieve our pictures.Buyer beware."
331,1,"Dont go off the photo, this thing is a literal brick in size and weight.","2008 called, they want their externally powered drive back. This thing is huge, the only reason Im keeping it is to migrate data off my other drives to this one. Otherwise if it were not for this time crunch it would be returned."
332,5,Durabilty,Perfect to save music
333,5,100% recommend,"Great storage, and easy to set up!"
334,4,Storage Capacity is Amazing!Wish the case wasn't a sealed unit,"I use these external units to back-up and safeguard import work/personal documents.I recently had a 250mb external HD fail due to a faulty connection port.I was able to unscrew the case and remove the HD for insertion into another unit and was able to recover the stored documents.My fear with this design is that if something other than the HD should fail, I might not be able to recover the drive's content.Other than that, it's a great little HD."
335,5,Great!!!!!,"I got this to download my compute onto so I can carry it with me.It did a beautiful job.It took a day to download it all, but it was worth it."
336,1,Failed Product,I had this for a time purchased in 2020. Stored some pics on it. Then hooked it up again and now it is worthless. Corrupted. Not worth buying
337,5,Nice transaction,More than enough room in storage and small enough to store in a drawer
338,1,El producto no funciona,El Producto no funciona
339,5,Easy to use on a Mac,"Plug it in, download needed extentions for Mac to use NTSF AND GO."
340,1,Function but Not Resiliant,"Functionally performs very well. Structurally unsound. After 15 months, the receptacle ceased to hold in place with a proper connection. Think of an i-phone, console, or aux cord that had to be held just right in order to properly function. A ""portable"" HD should be resilient to being plugged in and unplugged frequently while being slim and versatile (not requiring a power source impacted by various countries)."
341,1,Crashed and I lost Everything.,"I had this for about a month, just long enough for me to put everything important for work onto it. One day it started making a beeping sound and would not connect to my computer. I took it to a shop and they said a magnet had failed. The only way to retrieve my data is to send it to a company in Florida who will charge me upwards of $1,000 for the possibility partial retrieval. Do not buy this to store anything that matters."
342,1,"Advertised as PC & Mac compatible, but came preformatted to NTFS (for Windows).",deceptive title and description
343,5,Works great for my MacBook,I use this daily to store photos for my photography business.Took only a couple minutes to get it set up.Its small and easy to pack in my MacBook case.Would buy again.
344,5,Portable Harddrive,"We love this product - it has 2TB of storage, is easy to use, and is light and compact."
345,5,Great hard drive.,Works well without any issues or problems!!
346,4,Money well spent!!,"I purchased this drive to use as an external storage for my Playstation 4.I read reviews, looked at product videos etc. Because I was initially concern about comparative products that were advertised for use with the PS4, but did not work.I was pleasantly surprised with the ease with which the drive was setup and it's compatability with my PS4.I have been using the drives consistently now transferring application from my system to the external drive with relative ease.In addition the applications play from off the external drive with nk noticeable lag in performance or download of data.Thus far, this is a great purchase 👌"
347,2,"Just don't, it's not worth it","Pay for something that you plug in, it shows up on the comp, and it keeps showing up until you eject it. This ain't it"
348,5,Does what it's supposed to do,"I got it to back up and organize years of photos and videos.It's fast, has a ton of storage, and worked as it's supposed to, easily with no issues."
349,3,Hard drive was used,I don’t t remember anything that said this was a used drive.
350,5,This is great !,Well worth the money !
351,5,Me encanta es un buen producto precio calidad,The media could not be loaded. Me encanta es un buen producto precio calidad
352,5,Still working well!,"Works well so far, no issues!"
353,5,East to install for ps4,Easy to install. Already put two games in it
354,5,Good,It has 2 tb of storages and is pretty good
355,4,Buen producto,Es un producto muy fácil de usar y de gran capacidad
356,5,Works awesome for Ps4,"That's it, it works beautifully for Ps4"
357,5,Seagate Has Been In Business For Years...There's a Reason For That,"You can buy other brands there are plenty of them. There are only a few that have stood the test of time and are still in business. Seagate is one of those still standing. I've never had trouble with the 2, 2TB drives I bought. Faster transfer than most of those really cheesy SSD's they try and sell for $15.00. Want a good reliable drive you can't usually go wrong with a Seagate."
358,5,"Speedy, quiet, and so far, reliable","I bought this 5TB drive as a replacement for a similar 4TB model from WD that died an early death. I've only been using this one for a couple months, but so far, it's quiet and reliable. I'm getting about 285 mb/s write speeds over USB 3.0, which is surprisingly quick."
359,4,Disco externo con mucha capacidad.,"Me agradó, aunque hay que expulsarlo cuando apago el computador."
360,1,It finally died,"I bought this hard drive Feb. 2021, and today (Nov 2022) it just suddenly stopped working and all of my files are gone. I tried recovery, a different USB port, and a different cord but the light won't come on and its no longer working. I will not be buying from here anymore."
361,5,Good quality,"Exactly what I needed.Plenty of storage, good quality.Happy with purchase."
362,1,Lost all my data,"Bought this and used it once. I backed up all my data from my old PC. Then I attempted to transfer the data the next day to a new PC and the drive stopped working.The support team was terrible, they had so much background noise and they could barely hear me. After an hour they decided I should send the drive to them then a couple of weeks later they said they can't retrieve my data and sent me a replacement piece of junk free of charge. Never doing business with this company again."
363,1,Does Not Actually Back Up,"I got this one thinking it was the best due to it being Amazon’s choice, but you can’t actually backup anything on it. If you have a mac the only feature on it is mirroring files, but if you delete anything on your computer, it gets deleted on the mirror file too. Complete trash!"
364,1,RETURNED,"Unit was not compatible with my Dell/ Windows 10 computer. Seagate support was great, but after 40 minutes they decided that it would not work with my windows. All Seagate tests passed but it would not show up on file explorer."
365,5,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD,Seagate is still a good quality external hard drive and has been working well for me.I still trust the Seagate name and would buy their products again
366,2,Stopped working two months in,"I wouldn’t say I used this drive much. Was just a backup but it stopped working anyways.So if you’re looking for dependable storage, look elsewhere. I will say all the small portable drives Ive used in the past few years by other manufacturers have pretty much all failed to work after a few months. I have drives made 10 years ago that still work fine. Not sure what’s going on with the manufacturing of hard drives these days, but they just don’t work. And it’s terrible to have your photos or high qualitymusic files being stored on untrustworthy devices. That’s what we are left with as consumers."
367,3,Muy delicado,Sin estar dañado a fallado más que mis adata
368,5,Seagate 2tb external,"This unit gave me the storage I need plus, and it is so easy to use....just plug and play."
369,1,It doesn't work with my MAC,It doesn't work for my MAC
370,1,Failed at a month,iMac couldn’t see it after a month. It was working up till now. Piece of e-junk added to the pile.
371,5,Good price on an external,This is a good price on an external that holds a lot!
372,5,good enough,good enough
373,5,Still working.,"Still works.I was a bit scared because It was in a bit of heat.But so far, so good."
374,5,Perfecto,I use it for my Xbox one and I have more storage than I ever could use now!
375,1,"Not, repeat NOT MAC COMPATIBLE","First of all, zero set up instructions. The website was useless as well AND this supposed to be both MAC and PC compatible and it is NOT! It’s only Windows compatible."
376,3,"Good, but with issues","Within 6 weeks (but only one week of using it), my drive started vibrating, clicking and got very loud.Contacted Seagate and went through hours on tech support before finally being told to return it.Easy, right?I had less than 3TB of information on it which I needed to copy.I began the process and all I can say is DIRT SLOW.I know some people exaggerate, but I am on day 5 of copying 24hrs each day.Still shows more than a day remaining.I am taking into account that my drive has issues.If I had to do this over again I probably would have bought Seagate's 8TB or another brand and bought from another retailer.I already own the 8TB without issues.I have seen other complaints about the 12 TB having issues.When I get my replacement I will only use it to archive.On the plus;Seagate customer service was great, but in two cases I spent a minimum of two hours on the phone per case.They were good at reading the solutions they could have just emailed me to try on my own.Hopefully my RMA # won't expire before this drive lets me copy everything.In all fairness, I think Amazon should hold some accountability on this.This is the 2nd hard drive I have ordered from them and both were shipped with no packing.Placed in a plastic sleeve, not even a padded envelope.This is not an SSD drive and should be packaged well for shipping.When I told Seagate how it arrived they said;oh no, it should not be shipped that way.I will NOT be ordering another HD from Amazon unless solid state.Amazon, are you listening?"
377,5,Great Storage,Used to store my movies. Got plenty of storage. Just connect to your computer and start using. No problems so far.
378,5,satisfied,everything is backed up from my computer
379,1,Absolute garbage,Trash
380,5,Portability,Item is of superior quality! Delivery was very speedy. Immensely comely packaging. Seller is choice.
381,5,Good work,been using it on my ps4 was a little scared that now that I have a p5 I wouldn’t be able to use it but nope I can and it works the same as the p4 . I have about 10 games in it and still have storage available been having it for 2 year and never had no issue . Super easy to use as well
382,3,Great when it works,"I read a review about multiple plugs, but mine only came with 1, so no idea what they are talking about. It works great, but half the time my computer recognizes that it is plugged in and even the name shows up in devices, but I can't access it. I plug it in the same way as when it works. I usually end up plugging into several different usb ports before it works and I don't know which will work every time I try to use it. I want to use it to store my content as a creator, but not knowing when I can access it is inconvenient when I need to upload or work on my creations. I plan on buying a new cord to see if that is the issue, because sometimes I have to place it a certain way in order to get it to work."
383,1,I wish I could give this a 0,The IT department that watches my computer to make sure it stays uncompromised contacted me within 24 hours of plugging this into my computer and told me it has a virus on it so I can't even use it. They were able to stop it and protect my computer before anything happened but now I have a ton of data on there that may be lost but I can't look at it because of the virus that was on the Hardie when I got it.
384,5,Does the job,"Needed a external drive to move data to a new computer and this worked great.It's not going to win any speed test, but that's not why I bought it."
385,1,"worked great, for two weeks","The media could not be loaded. at the time when I bought this in August of 2021, it worked well and did what it should, but it's when around the second week of having it, it didn't show up on my Xbox at all, sometimes it did but it was super rare. now (October 2022) all it does is blink when I connect it to my Xbox, great product but didn't last long"
386,5,Can’t really go wrong with Seagate as new,Surprisingly fast and very reliable.
387,1,Impossible Interface,"Might’ve worked when I first uploaded it (just like these “reviewers” who open it and see that their computer recognizes the device after commenting on the length of the usb cord). However, I don’t see how the information is stored, don’t see how to update my backup, and have no idea how I’d ever restore my files using this device. Who cares if the files are in there if I have no idea how to update its contents and get them off of it?Tech support only during the workday is useless - spending unknown time on what should be automated during my work hours is not a solution."
388,5,"So Far, So Good 👍","I purchased two of these hard drives, one for my computer and the other for my Tablo console. Yes, I'm one of those ""Cut the Cable"" people. It's a decision I made many years ago and have not regretted it. With Tablo, I need the hard drive if I want to record the programs I receive through my indoor OTA (over the airways) antenna."
389,1,Failed after two weeks,"This is the first time I've had this happen, but mine failed about two weeks after purchasing with only light and normal use. Write speed began to slow down (could watch it happen) until it would no longer write normally. Likely a lemon/defective item."
390,1,Piece of junk,"Throwing ""The IO operation at logical block address 0x0 for Disk 5 (PDO name: \Device\0000007f) failed due to a hardware error."" errors, tried Seatools, chkdsk, reformat, changing USB port; noting fixed the errors.Then I find it's a one year warranty. It seems like every Seagate I purchased for work or home has failed."
391,1,im done buying from seagate,This particular drive failed after just over 2 months of use. Can't even plug it in to the computer without crashing the computer. I've had too many seagates do the same in the past but at least they lasted longer than 2 months. and customer support was such a pain. its far too much of a hassle to deal with them anymore.
392,1,Worked for less than a month and now its dead,Thats it. 50+ spent on something that lasted less than a month. Disappointed is an understatement
393,5,4tb external harddrive,nice having the extra space for backup
394,1,Not formatted for Mac's - inaccurate website description,"This hard drive is formatted for NTFS file systems, yet is advertised as ""for Mac.""If you actually want to USE the hard drive with a mac, look elsewhere! Otherwise you will be stuck using it for PC and only read-only on mac.Disappointed that Amazon still has not corrected the website description despite several years' worth of other customers who discovered the same thing."
395,5,Very needed!,Very needed! Bought this at a time my computer ran out of space because I shoot content and edit alot. I still use it now.If you need to make space on my computer or for what ever else I recommend this!It's an easy on the go type of product. You can access all the info you need to with just plugging it in to another computer/laptop you need.
396,4,"Brown box special, plain box no usb port, only a usb sata connector]]",I thought i bought a hub but i clicked on theweong button next to the hub. Choice. For$5 more the hub version is a better choice snd I am having a hard time getti g window to accept it
397,5,PS4 8TB EXTERNAL HD,"well I just got it today and it works great so far with my PS4, after formatting it went down to 7.35 TB still a huge amount of storage space imo, it's not loud can barely hear it, it does have some weight to it tho....I recommend it, definitely worth it"
398,5,Had to pay return,Ordered wrong sorry
399,5,Small and powerfull,Work great as MacBook time machine back up storage
400,3,Not bad,Not bad but it should come with a proper case. Also overpriced
401,2,How does it work?,"Seagate is a good name. They send you a packet with 12 different languages, but the English language doesn't explain how this device works. Daah! So, what am I missing?"
402,5,Back up is a must,I use this with Time Machine on my Mac.Almost silent operation. Plug and play ease of use.
403,1,Don't buy. Save your money.,Item stopped working few days after 1 month.
404,4,Buena capacidad de almacenamiento,Algunos juegos no los deja correr directo desde la unidad externa
405,4,"Works well, noisy","So far this is working well for me, but I'm a bit worried at how much it clicks and whirrs - not only when starting up but when writing to it at all. Keeping things backed up here and elsewhere just in case it dies. Will update this review if anything happens to it."
406,5,Worked out of the box,"I just got the drive and plan to use it for periodic backups.I did not use any of the software provided on the drive.Rather, I am just manually copying all my files to this drive. The drive has 7.7T of free space.I'll try to update this review after some months."
407,1,Died in less than a year. Was only good for 9 months.,"It was a good size, but the drive now has completely failed. I used it with my PS5 to hold my PS4 games and now it can't be used. When I connect it to my PC to format it, it can't even do that. So the drive is completely dead."
408,5,Seagate it is!,"I have always loved me a seagate drive.Can possibly not, goo wrong with it.Don't hesitate, buy it.Writing this review after 5 months of use."
409,4,Good Storage,But the cable comes loose super easy and takes forever to reload once plugged back in
410,5,"Big storage, I've yet to have a problem with a Seagate hard drive.","Big storage, I've yet to have a problem with a Seagate hard drive."
411,1,It was not compatible with my Mac,Didn’t work as it was instructed
412,1,This disc does not work with Mac even though it says it does.,I ordered it because it said it was compatible with iMac.There is no software to start up with OS.
413,1,Disappointment,"In the description it lists playstation 4 being compatible with it, it is not!When I plugged it in, it says this device is not compatible. I hope this was an honest mistake and not a lie"
414,5,Works perfectly fine,product is quality and its worth the price.i love it
415,5,External Storage,Super item at a great price with great delivery
416,5,very good,worked like a charm
417,5,My main hardrive,"I’ve had this for about 5 years now, no problems, no physical problems either, has barely slowed down with all my photos on it from school and work!"
418,3,"Works well, but have my doubts.","Drive has plenty of space. I have issues with the noise (rattles when disc is spinning; sounds like it is about to fail). Data recall is on the slow side (won't fault that issue because of the storage capacity, well within acceptable wait time). I am overall satisfied with this product."
419,5,A bargain,Value
420,3,Unsatisfied with delievery,"It came like this, the whole box was broken"
421,5,Nice Drive To Have,I've used this for a while now.. Great for backup files. I don't really like loading games on it much though.
422,1,Useless...,"An external hard drive that won't mount is useless, which is what this piece of junk is. My only advice is stay away. This is my second problem with a Seagate Drive. I will never buy another one!"
423,5,A little less,It’s storage is a little less than what it says but it is still really good
424,5,just as advertised,works great quite didn't need much setup. had mine almost 3 months no problems at all
425,5,Seagate One Touch Hub 20TB External Hard Drive Desktop HDD,"If you need a LOT of storage space, this is the drive for you.Note however, that it comes formatted as exFAT, which may be good if you use other systems in addition to Microsoft, but in my case I don't, so I easily reformatted it to NTFS before using it.With that in mind, it's an awesome drive.Some may complain about the speed, but since I use it strictly as an archive drive, I have no problem with it.Expensive, yes, but since I startedhaving problems with the smaller (physical and storage size) 5TB drives, I decided that the expense was worth the P.O.M. that this Seagate drive provides.I've had good luck with Seagate drives in the past, so I expect this to perform as well.However, always keep in mind that YMMV, and what works for me may not work for you.For meit does EXACTLY what I need it to do!"
426,2,Fsilure shortly,Failed within 6 months
427,5,"Works well, easy to set up and use","The drive was simple to set up and worked flawlessly during the time I had it.Unfortunately, I lost the device and my home on Fort Myers Beach Florida during Hurricane Ian, so I only had it for a short time.I will be buying a new one just as soon as possible as I really liked it’s ease of use"
428,1,Doesn't format or connect,Unfortunately this doesn't format despite me trying on two windows laptops and a chromebook. It won't connect to my chromebook at all. My Asus vivobook formated it to NTFS. It wouldn't link back to my Asus and wouldn't link to my HP chromebook. I tried reformatted it with my HP stream laptop to the same NTFS and now it doesn't appear on any of the computers.It turns on and isn't making any weird noises. Sadly I think I got a dud. I'll update it I can get it working but for now it looks like I'll be sending this back.
429,1,Worked fine for a while,This worked fine for a while but crashed after a little over a year. The head got stuck on the disk and started making a beeping sound.The drive was no longer recognizable.
430,5,"Fast, plenty of storage, and portable","exactly what i was looking for -- transfers large amounts of data very quickly, and even though bigger than a usb, still very small and light to fit into a laptop case."
431,5,Very Compact,Huge storage capacity
432,1,Defective,Anything from sea gate needs to be avoided. Always defective. Crashes my PC when I plug it in and refuses to give a refund. Just warranty coverage.Unacceptable
433,1,Defective product,"I got this for my Birthday and It doesn't work at all. Every time i plug it in, it crashes my whole computer to the point i have to hard reset my PC. Refusing to return funds. stay far away"
434,4,Right size,"Had to have help getting it programmed for receiving the backup data. After that, works fine."
435,1,FALSE advertising! Misleading product info,"NOT RECOMMENDED Says that it works for Mac, but it does not. Should not be sold as such. And I'm not allowed to return at this point so I'm out $62 for a useless product.FALSE ADVERTISING AND COMPLETELY MISLEADING. CANNOT TRUST THE SELLER."
436,1,Not for macs,Does not work for macs. Misleading product title and description.
437,5,Works with ps4,Might say not compatible at first but either give it time or take it out and plug it in again.
438,1,Broken,"The thing no longer works after a few months, and I no longer has the box it came in so I can't use the warranty on it which is my own fault I know."
439,1,Do Not Buy This,"Plugged in HD, and as soon as I attempted to move some files it crashed. I had to hard restart my comp twice . everything is working fine but I am definitely not plugging this little box of death into my comp again."
440,5,Reliable product. Immediate setup. Instant recognition.,Backup storage.
441,5,Perfect,Good price does what you need it to do! Does not take up space
442,5,One of the best known brands.,"I remember when Seagate was THE only name in hard drives.Now there are many to choose from, but these have still been a solid contender and haven’t had any issues with any drives I’ve purchased. I even have old old old Seagate drives that will still power up from 20+ years ago.Amazing what you find in your basement."
443,1,"it says right ON the PAGE - WORKS WITH MAC, PC....IT DOESN'T.... JUST FORMATED FOR PC",I dislike that I bought this- the return window closed because I was too busy to use this portable drive and now I'm stuck with a useless POS. the listing states that it works with MAC. It does NOT
444,5,Useful,I own a PS5 and this storage device was able to hold all of my PS4 games and new ones I got from PS+ it's a really good product I like it.
445,5,Great!,"Does the job if your consol have limited internal storage, portable too!"
446,3,Needed a Replacement,"The original one I was given would not save files to it. Once I requested a replacement, I had no issues."
447,3,great product except dangerous case design!,"I have always been happy with any Seagate Desktop External Hard Drive I purchased.They work very well for data archival and retrieval.This drive appears to work fine also.BUT it has a very serious design flaw!!!The exterior case is downright dangerous!The edges are knife sharp and the corners are needle sharp!What were the case designers thinking?????Go back to your nice safe old case design before you get sued by some parent whose kid gets cut open by this dangerous ""aesthetic"" design!!!!"
448,1,Not Good,"What a complete piece of JUNK! And yes, it was connected in the USP 3.0 slot. It you like to watch oil paint dry or have nothing else to do with your time, buy this drive."
449,5,Works Great,"I brought this for my PS4 because I was running out of storage. I decided to buy Seagate because its compatible with PS4. The setup is easy. I moved 2 of my games to the external storage and played the games with no issue. I keep my plugged in. If you need to removed it always disconnect through stop device settings, it will mess up the files otherwise. Other than that, its a must have."
450,1,"lasted 24 hours, then stopped working. No more Seagate for me!","Terrible, lost all data in 24 hours"
451,5,AWESOME AWESOME PRODUCT,WORKED RIGHT AWAY WAS ABLE TO FIND ON MY LAPTOP. GREAT QUALITY LOTS ON SPACE
452,5,Sweet hard drive,"I bought this 2 TB Seagate to use as a back-up to my Passport, it transferred everything from my 1 TB Passport very quickly. I'm thinking about using the Seagate as my regular portable hard drive and using the Passport as my back-up"
453,5,SATISFIED,"Using it for my PC , working great"
454,1,Lasted less than a year - don't transfer directories with many files!,"Bought in January 2022 and tried storing a folder with lots of small files in it, ended bricking the drive. Would not recommend"
455,5,Just what I needed,"Works as expected, backed up pics with no problem"
456,5,It is what it is,"Arrived on time. Packaged exactly how you see in the photo.No physical damage as i could see. Interesting how simple the packaging was. I wondered if it was really ""new"" as it wasn't sealed or anything. But after i connected to my computer all was good. Capacity was exactly 2 TB. You don't see that anymore. Usually they dont give you the full capacity.Its always 1.9 or 1.95 etc. Lol. Anyway,happy with it!! Transfered all my movie files to free up my hard drive."
457,5,Its great,"First of the convience of getting from amazon was nice. Shipped over night, great deal at a great price. If you font have time to go to the store and browse. Just get this."
458,5,Really a good drive,I tried another less expensive type first but it wasn't as easy to use or compatible across platforms like this is. Worth the cost.
459,5,Easy to use.,"I was surprised at how small this device is, but it is easy to us and holds all that I need it to hold."
460,3,Eh,"It's splitting hairs, but I feel kinda ripped off.This is actually a 3.63tb drive and not 4tb.That's like buying a new car and not getting a spare tire.Sure everything works but I paid for 4tb not almost 4tb...That missing .37 is actually alot of data storage."
461,5,STORED DATA,EASE OF USE
462,5,Easy to Use,I bought this for my Hubs. He connected it to his Sony Playstation 5. He loves it. Plugs right into the Playstation and is ready to use. He can save his games much easier now. It's a great value!
463,5,Great to have,Works great easy installation
464,1,Not working at all.,Dead shortly after a few months of purchase.
465,1,Acabo de perder todo mi trabajo por culpa de este disco.,"Recomiendo a todos no comprar esto, he perdido todo mi trabajo , dioosss que hago ahoraaa !!!!"
466,1,Not Mac compatible,Although the title reads 'Mac Compatible' this device is not.
467,5,Xbox,Worked great for my Xbox one and will use it for laptop too
468,5,Tons of storage,It’s pricey but it had plenty of storage and works great with my gaming pc!
469,5,Good product,Son does a lot of editing and shooting videos and movies and likes this product a lot
470,1,BEWARE!! Do NOT buy if you have a macOS device!,"macOS users, do not waste your money!The description of this product is INCORRECT: this device does NOT work with macOS devices. The drive is formatted with Microsoft's NTFS file format. Therefore, you cannot move or remove data from the drive on any Apple device. Very disappointed and regret purchasing this."
471,5,Good,Bought it a couple months ago and so far so good haven’t had any problems
472,5,100% AS DESCRIBED,"WORKS GREAT, EASY TO INSTALL, ZERO ISSUES SO FAR.PERFECT FOR CLEARING SPACE ON YOUR MAIN DRIVE."
473,5,"Muy buen disco, tal cual como lo anuncian.",Un muy buen disco lo utilice como almacenamiento ampliado en mi PS4 y todo funciona de maravilla.
474,1,DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC,I bought this to transfer files between a windows laptop and Mac and it is locked on my Mac and I can’t use it . It is advertised that it works with Macwhich it clearly doesn’t !
475,1,Backup Failures Every time,"I really wanted to like this drive.I was excited to finally see a 7200 rpm external drive.That excitement was short-lived.It has now stopped 6x while trying to back up an internal drive.Beyond the failures, it's no faster than my most recent WD My Book Desktop drives to which I'll continue to use after this fiasco.I love my Seagate Exos internal drives but this drive is beyond disappointing.I should have listened to the reviews.To Seagate - please get your act together before pushing anymore of these on the market!"
476,5,Exceeded Expectations,I purchased this after months of struggling with my Lenovo dock which kept dropping my screen image from my laptop's external manager. This product has more of the cable connections that I need to efficiently work.
477,5,Does what it's supposed to do,"Bought this because a classmate recommended it for a class. I rarely use it but when I have, it has worked great."
478,4,Not bad for size,I like it. Hopefully it works out great.
479,5,Works great,I bought this for my son to use as an external HD for his XBox. It has worked great without any issues. It connected and formatted without any issues and as holding up greatly with nonstop use.
480,5,Sea gate Hard Drive - works Well,Excellent Hard Drivecwhich doesn’t take up much space next to computer.
481,5,"Dependable, affordable 1TB drive.",Bought two for a special event for photo storage. No issues. Sturdy construction. I'm sure I'll buy them again
482,5,Good,Reliable storage space for Xbox!
483,5,PS4 drive,Works good
484,4,Good for a console,Work great for my xbox one.
485,2,Stopped working after 5 months,"Bought the 4TB disk as a backup disk for my personal Macbook(2TB) in May 2022. It worked fine until now. Now, in October 2022, after barely 5 months, it stopped working. The laptop just won't recognize it. Just a month or so ago, the Seagate drive I used for my work Macbook stopped working (corrupt). I think I will not use Seagate disks anymore."
486,5,I used it for storage and it’s stable so Far East to set up with Mac book pro,It’s compact plus stays cool in the office great for storage of data up load speeds are Sufficient
487,4,EASY TO INSTALL . . .,"I have read about difficulties with installing this drive, but I did not have this experience.I am a Mac user and have 2009 iMac. Because the drive is formatted for Windows, I used Disk Utility to erase the drive.Erasing the drive also formatted it for Mac.Then, I again used Disk Utility to run First Aid.After that, I selected the disk to use for Time Machine.It has been working the way it should, and I have not noticed the noise mentioned by other reviewers.As for tech support, I haven't needed it, so I can't comment on that.All I can say is, ""so far, so good"" ..."
488,5,Works perfect for extended consol storage,"We have one for the Xbox and one for the PS5. Both work really well, never any lag or issues (yet)"
489,1,Unmountable after transferring data for weeks,"After weeks of laboriously transferring data to this drive from other external drives, one day it just stopped being mountable. It would appear in the Mac OSX Disk Utility but could not be mounted and First Aid returned an error.It's unbelievable how much time I wasted transferring all that data, just to have the drive die when I was so close to being done.I can't even delete my data from it so I can return it, so I'll just have to eat the cost or send it for recovery but I do not trust any technician with my data."
490,5,Fast transfer rate.,Fast transfer rate.
491,5,The other name brand prior that just broke at the price better quality,"I am extremely pleased surprised and grateful that I stumbled upon this brand recently. I purchased another suppose it suppose a top brand SSD it worked after about an hour then it stopped, when purchases one have had no issues lightning fast quiet portable what's not to like?I am extremely pleased surprised and grateful that I stumbled upon this brand recently. I purchased another suppose it suppose a top brand SSD it worked after about an hour then it stopped, when purchases one have had no issues lightning fast quiet portable what's not to like?"
492,1,Doesn’t work!! Don’t buy!,"The things doesn’t work!My son was waiting for this item and disappointed that it doesn’t even work for his PS4! Could have used that money to get one elsewhere, now we have to go thru the hassle of returning it and waiting for a refund!!"
493,5,Nice space available for the extra stuff,Storage capacity
494,5,Capability,As at right now I did not have an issue
495,4,Great for the price,"A lot of memory for the price.Sometimes my computer has a 2-3 second delay accessing the drive but, italways works. This may be due to my usb extension or just that vast amount of space my computer has to acknowledge on the huge drive. I’m happy with it."
496,1,Works just long enough to not be returnable,"It stopped working about 3 weeks in, and I wasn’t able to return it in time for the 30 day refund.The product has a page you can find through Amazon on what to do if the thing stops working, but none of the steps helped at all, so now I’m stuck with a 60 dollar paperweight. I grew up with this technology, so it wasn’t user error. A bunch of my files are now gone forever, too.So yeah, not too happy, wouldn’t recommend."
497,3,Check your storage,"So far it hasn’t provided a difference but it could be my computer, my issue is that it says 2TB when it’s really 1TB so be careful."
498,1,Malfunctions constantly,I have lost so much data with this thing it's not even funny. Everytime I plug it up it says there is a problem with it and asks me to format it therefore deleting everything in it. Terrible. Don't recommend
499,1,Not what it claims to be,"The Seagate product5 does not work.It claims just plug it in, no software needed.Gives immediate extra storage.This is false.I've been working with their tech support for a month and they don't seem to understand simple requests and answers.then they just don't answer.I hope I can return this worthless piece of equipment.Buyer beware."
500,5,Good!,"It’s good, nothing to complain about but don’t expect it to run very large games smoothly."
501,5,Works,Works as intended. Was able to copy my DVR recordings to it no problem.
502,5,Backup drive for PS4,So far working ok..
503,5,Excelente,"Excelente producto, entregado en el tiempo establecido"
504,1,Click click dud,“Click of death”…lame.
505,5,"Low Cost, Small and Data Transfer is Fast","I took it out of the box, plugged it into my PC and started backing up my files. No issues."
506,5,PS5 Storage,Works great with my PS5...
507,1,this does not work for Mac,I plugged it in and it popped up when I try to move something to it nothing happens I've trying to unplug and retry and n nothing changes this does not work for my Mac
508,5,Great,Love it!
509,5,Great,"Lightweight, easy to set up. I use it as my second hard drive for my laptop."
510,3,Should’ve saved and got a bigger one.,1TB runs out relatively quickly save your money and get a bigger hard drive or an SSD. Hard Disk Drives are slow and becoming dated.
511,1,Crashed within six months andost everything.,"Came back from work and suddenly the files are in RAW format. Long story short, I lost my files. Twenty years of music. Hundreds of hours of video. And a lifetime of work. I can't even reformat it."
512,5,They Work,"I have many of these hard drives and I keep buying them because of their quality, reliability and convenience of use."
513,5,Exelente,Buen Producto de calidad
514,3,returned,could not get it to work right. returned to Kohls for refund
515,5,Works way better than the older Western Digital,"I like this detached hard drive. My very first one decade ago was a Seagate. I use this for backing up my notebook computer. I hope I never have to test its ability to restore.I would recommend this. Fast back up, too."
516,1,Hard drive fails,Purcahsed this is 2020 and currently it will not work. When I plug it into the computer it is not recognized. Light blinks and it makes a beeping noise. Currently in the process of trying to find someone to get all the information off the hard drive. Very disappointing and annoying. Never have I had this issue with an external hard drive.
517,1,The Drive Broke Within 60 Days,Drive was unaccessible withing 60 days of purchase.
518,3,Not compatible with my modestly older system,"Although I have a 2 TB external USB drive similar to this one (which is twice the size), it is incompatible with my modestly older Win10 PC. The product description for this unit should include warnings that it may not work unless your gear is pretty new, and to list what system specifications are required for its operation. Since I'm planning to upgrade my PC, I'll keep it (and it works on my ToughBook Win10) but the description needs to be clear and honest about its requirements."
519,2,Fails way too soon,Drive failed after about 10 months of use. I know mechanical hard drives have a 100% failure rate but I expect this to last at least two years or longer since it never leads my house and pretty much stayed on or near my desktop the entire time I had it.
520,3,Very Decent,"Depends on what your use case is, but if you plan to use it on a daily basis Id suggest going elsewhere. This is a dependable device, but only in the sense that it works, not in the sense that it works well. It reads and writes very slowly, and can cause your computer to buffer indefinitely sometimes. I made the mistake of buying two thinking that maybe the first one was just old, the second one doesn't have the buffer issue, but for some reason doesn't record when I open files, which is frustrating when you're trying to go by ""date last opened"" sorting system."
521,1,Broke after 3.5 months. Don't buy!,"I bought this for my MacBook Pro laptop and it stays on my desk. I never took it with me outside of the home. I did sometimes use my laptop in my living room and moved the ""portable"" drive with me. All of a sudden it stopped working. And naturally, the window to return it is over. Money wasted!!"
522,1,Dead drive. Its a paper weight.,They shipped me a dead drive. Windows doesn't recognize. It's just a paperweight. Now they want me to pay $7 to have it picked up.
523,1,NOT RELIABLE AT ALL,Hard drive literally only works when it wants not reliable at all. I had the 1TB one and now I have the 4TB one and they both just aren’t useful definitely would only recommend another brand like LaCie.
524,5,Lots of storage,"I emptied my phone's pictures and videos from the past year onto this storage device, and it took up so little space. I have lots of extra space to store our memories now."
525,1,It just suddenly stopped working,"I've bought 2 of these hard drives, however, one failed in less than a year (bought in december, failed in october). It just stopped being recognized by the pc. I tried the seagate tool (seatool) and it showed that it had faulty sectors. short and long tests failed to perform. the hard drive essentially died suddenly, with no explanation. I lost all of my information in that drive."
526,4,Good Drive for Good price,"Easy to setup and use. Purchased to store pics and videos and works good. Earlier I used WD which is great and it is similar to that. The hard drive is light and portable, hope its durable too.Not sure about the tech support too as i haven't encountered any issues as of now."
527,3,Did not work with Mac,Took a significant amount of troubleshooting to get it to work with my Mac. I had to go through the steps multiple times but it did end up recognizing it.
528,1,High hopes dashed,"Right out the box wouldn't allow me to format,I tried putting it to my laptop,computer and my Xbox each time it said to format and each time it would give an error while trying to do so"
529,5,Smooth and fast. Worked great for pc storage.,Smooth and fast. Worked great for pc storage.
530,4,Great compact,Size is great for on the go
531,1,New Drive Was Clicking And Did Not Work,I bought this POS and the drive was clicking and didnt work whatsoever. Terrible now i have to deal with returning it
532,4,Works great with Xbox X,I knew there had to be a cheaper option than buying the console branded expansion pack. This item works perfectly
533,1,might not work with mac,"I bought this product knowing someone else who has one and it works for them on their HP. I have a mac and I saw in the product description that this product would be compatible with my mac. However, when I got it and tried it out I got a pop up saying it does not work with mac. not happy"
534,5,Perfect,Does the job great!!!Glad I made the purchase
535,5,"The website helps you set it up mostly, very easy to use.",I used this to hold some of my games for my gaming pc and it works very well.
536,5,Son was happy,Son got this because his Xbox has hardly any storage. He was so happy to get this and it has worked out great for him and his gaming needs
537,5,easy to use,I have had this unit for some time now & is working just fine.
538,1,Stopped working 2 months later.Disappointed!,"Stopped working 2 months later.Buzzes with blue light on solid not blinking, and doesn’t show on my computer. I use Mac. Very disappointed! Always been a seagate guy.Looked YouTube for a solution and I was not the only one.Many said it stop working on an average of one year. Broke in a Saturday. No customer service available during the weekend."
539,5,2TB hard drive,Love this hard drive for my Xbox One
540,4,No quick start guide,"The write up for this Seagate XHD indicated it was compatible with Microsoft and Apple products and that it was plug and play. It came with no quick start guide. I plugged it in, it came on, and I tested dragging and dropping a document. It didn't work. I went to Seagate and registered the XHD and went on their chat. There I found that it was set up for Microsoft; to use it on Mac, I had to download software - how 1980's. This is my third Seagate XHD and that's never happened to me before. Why did I have to go on a hunt for it when they could have just included a link to the software with the hard drive? I knocked off one star for poor customer information."
541,4,Good for older devices,"I use this external for my Xbox Series S, it works great and very easy to use. The only issue I ran into is this external isn't made for the newer consoles specifically, so newer games have to be downloaded to the internal drive to play and can only “store” them in the external."
542,5,Great softwear,We love it
543,5,Storage for ps4,Works great
544,5,Perfect,"A very nice external, plenty of room for all the games we play!"
545,5,Great,Very nice
546,5,Nice,Used to store music
547,5,Great product.,Great product.
548,5,This works great... Perfect for using with video...,I use this with my Tablo TV. I can pause live OTA TV and record. I save a bunch from cutting cable and using an antenna for my local channels... Perfect Hard Drive...
549,5,Better Than Expected!,"Got this for my son to use with his Xbox because anytime he'd want to play any of his favorite games it would take him forever to get started.Found out it was because he was deleting Fortnite to play Apex, and deleting that to play Rainbow 6, and that for GTA5 to COD and back around again.Oh hell no if he wanted to play Lego Batman (smh).So I figured this would do the trick.His father was skeptical because he'd had the 2GB and at least it happened before the warranty expired, but it crashed and had to be replaced which the warranty DOES NOT COVER!It covers trying to rescue your data on the device.Which like never happens, and why bother?My data is all backed up in an XBox cloud somewhere.It is secure, what is not secure is you device and sneaky way of making the consumer think you got them covered.Sorry, ""Oops your data could not be recovered)fake apology just doesn't cut it.But there aren't a whole lot of choices and Amazon has a good deal on this 5GB so figured we could give it a try.That was Birthday in July of 2022 and so far so good.Writes and reads fast as hell and hopefully he won't run out of space anytime soon.Definitely worth the money, I will update this if it changes."
550,4,Install software problems,Mine works good but it needs to be unplugged be for starting the computer or the computer locks up and won't initialize. I start the computer without it plugged in then after everything is up and running I plug it back in and all is well
551,4,So far so good.,The media could not be loaded.
552,2,10% missing,"After removing the bloatware, it's 1.8 TB. I get it that it's a little less. 10% is too much."
553,5,Works great,This worked great on my PS4. I no longer have to delete games to make room
554,5,It was everything I expected,It was everything I expected
555,5,Works perfectly,The media could not be loaded. Works perfect I totally recommend
556,1,not mac compitable,not mac compatible.didn't come with setup instructions.
557,4,Been using for 2.5 years and still works,"This drive has held WAY more than I was expecting. I am a photographer and often shoot over 200 images per session. I have a file for the RAW images and then a file for the final gallery jpeg images and sometimes another separate file for social media size images and I still have plenty of space. I am about to purchase another for the reason that the port for plug in seems to be getting loose and about 20% of the time it disconnects in the middle of my editing process and I have to re-edit whatever I was working on. I only blame the manufacturer a portion because I carry this in my backpack daily so I can edit at work and at home, so I think just it being in the pocket has sort of messed up the port if I didn't remove the cord prior to putting it in the pocket. I have never needed to use tech support, so I cannot rate that."
558,1,Seller lied.Not work on a MAC,I wasted 2.5 hours trying to figure out why it wouldn't mount. Only the windows.exe file is on the drive itself.Timemachine not pick it up and their software download said that it will not work on my version of ios.It was a complete absolute nightmare. I wasted an entire morning when all I wanted to do was backup!the description said compatible with Mac and that is a big FAT LIE!!!!!
559,5,Good purchase.,"My order was delivered on time. The package was secure and the product was in good condition. This hard drive is nice and slim, very portable and holds a ton of stuff I need to backup. I would recommend it."
560,5,Nice 👍 to have,"A little complicated in the beginning, but easy after"
561,4,works well,as expected
562,5,Great storage capacity!,"I love this hard drive never gives me any problems and has 4tb of space it works extremely well, I would highly recommend this."
563,5,Sea gate fan since 1994,I’ve had HD failures with other major brands. Never a glitch with Seagate. I am proude of my Seagate purchases!
564,3,It was great at first...,It was good at first I had no problems but then it started saying it was not disconnected properly. I didn't do anything differently but it randomly started giving me this message. Now my game files are corrupted and if I want to play them I have to delete them and reinstall them. It's too much of a hassle. Enjoy it while lasts. Mine lasted 2 years then started giving me problems.
565,5,NICE,NICE
566,5,Husband Xbox,Idk which Xbox he has maybe it’s a one but it works great.
567,1,I orderd 2 GB. AND ITS ONLY 1.8 on there!,The Numbers don’t match up and my Sims Game refuses to LOAD on it. I’m very upset. I’m gonna have to return it.
568,5,Great,Great easy to use
569,5,SUPER EASY TO USE!!,"I hate having to read a bunch of instructions and this SEAGATE portable hard drive is so easy to use all I did was plug it into my computer, registered the product, and backed up my laptop in minutes.I am ordering another one to use for all my photos, that way i have them all on one drive rather than a bunch of discs."
570,5,"Great product, Fast to write","Writes fast, a lot of storage"
571,2,Was not compatible with my Mac laptop,"This hard drive did not work with my Macbook. I managed to go into my disk utilities and reconfigure it to be compatible, but it went from 4TB of storage to less than 1TB, which is super disappointing. Feels like a waste of money."
572,5,Works great,Bought for my son. He loves it so far. No complaints
573,5,Literally Aweosme,"We've always liked Seagate products, but this one is our ultimate recommendation. It's literally plug-in and go. Runs smoothly, and we were able to backup several computers with, including all our 1000s of photos and videos, and still have space."
574,5,Simple,Exactly what I wanted and expected from a simple TB drive; stores everything with plenty of room to spare (mostly RAW and PNG files but also a significant number of PDFs).
575,5,Great external HD!,"Love this product.Easy setup, works great!"
576,1,Died,Completely stopped working less than 2 months of arriving and it was occasionally used in that time frame.
577,1,Stopped working after 1 week,Was great for a week. Then it started beeping and the computer wouldn't read it. Online said that this is because it's not getting enough power and happens with old devices. Now I have brick with photographs on it.I tried ALL the computers in my house for this and got nowhere.
578,3,Returned it,"Had to return, I felt like it was a waste of money"
579,1,I had to return it wasn’t updating my mac,I have lots of seagate hard drives and never had a problem but this one wouldn’t updating my backup
580,5,Swag,"Very cool, very swag, I like it!"
581,5,Good product,Works as expected
582,2,External hard drive,I had purchased two of them for both of my son’s and one is still working and the other one doesn’t work anymore kinda upset that it just stopped working
583,5,They back their product,"Had a problem (wouldn't read) with HD justafter a month of use, I called and their response was both professional and rapid. Seagate not only replaced the hard drive but also recovered my original media. I couldn't have asked for more.Thank you for your assistance Seagate, you've earned a loyal customer with me."
584,5,Works Just Dandy,It replaced a broken external hard drive and worked just fine right out of the box.
585,1,Crap Hard Drive,I've tried two of these now. Bought the first one and returned because it just stopped working. Received a replacement and now that one has died on me. Terrible product. Get it together Seagate. DO NO BUY.
586,1,Didn't work with Mac,Supposedly good with both Win & Mac. Fine with PC but wouldn't work at all with Mac....didn't show up despite trying everything...couldn't see it let alone copy anything to it. Returning. Ordered Toshiba Canvio Flex.....worked like a dream with both PC & Mac.
587,4,It has memory,Spacious
588,1,"Drive DEAD after 3 years, 3 months","Drive was bought to use as a backup. It was used about once a month to backup files.After three years, the drive light stopped going on, it makes a pitiful squeak when plugged in, and no computer recognizes it.So if you want to buy this item, consider buying it again once every 2 years so that you don't lose all of your data."
589,2,Lots of Noise?,The picture shows how it arrived...16TB (really 14TB though) packed with a single bubble pack to protect the hard-drive from bouncing around.I've had the HD for a few days now and it's been making quite a bit noise.Going to contact support tomorrow to find out what's going on. Will update this when I do.
590,1,Used,I paid full price for a brand new item.Item arrived and it was just now realized over a month later that someone had already used it and downloaded content onto the drive
591,5,So far so good 👍,"Great product 👌 so far so goodNo problem, super easy super price 👌 👍 😀"
592,5,Muy buen producto,Muy buen producto
593,4,Must format to work on MacOS,"This was not mentioned in the information and I had to figure it out myself. This hard drive is formatted for Windows out of the box. If you are using it with a Mac, in order to change it from ""read-only"" to a writable drive, you must erase it using Disk Utility. Look up a tutorial. Very easy. Works now."
594,1,Says it is fitted for MAC- but its not,Item says it can write to a MAC but it wont.
595,4,Works despite computer,"This is a very good standard hard disk drive for backups and I have another like it I have been using for perhaps 3 years on a different computer. The only problem is that external hard drives won’t reboot unless dragged to trash first on my new Mac Studio Max. This is crazy. I imagine this affects backups. There is no way to add a second internal disk. Apple needs to figure these problems out to help users and associated companies. I’m happy with Seagate, itself."
596,1,Don’t buy it,It didn’t save anything and I lost ALL of my work.
597,5,👍,good choice.
598,1,Confusing.!.!.,"Omg.I just want to BACK UP before my PC crashes & I LOSE everything.2 TB, could it BE more confusing??No instructions. No Manual. No “PLUG & PLAY”.I’m LOST in SPACE… 🤷‍♂️After an hour I found ‘click to install’. Then. NOTHING!I had a Seagate TWO YEARS Ago that I RETURNED because of this BS. … . Still the same. Hahahaha … I click “Getting Started” and am directed to…. YOU TUBE!Still no good.Soooo disappointed.Beautiful item. Good price. Useless. :-(.What’s WRONG with this company.?.?.?."
599,2,This thing sucks….,"I never write reviews but I’ve had this thing for almost a year now and I HATE it.Every time I use it, every so often, it disconnects from my computer even tho I never did. I’ll be in the middle of a game and next thing you know, I’m kicked because the hard drive decided to disconnect from my laptop. This thing is crap and I will never order another sea gate hard drive again."
600,5,Love,Love it
601,5,Two Terabytes at a good price.,"I like this 2T Seagate Portable External hard drive. Plug it in an it works. Transferred all my media, freed up my computer."
602,5,"Good price, flawless operation.","I have gotten replacement Seagate hard drives for my old Dell Inspiron 1100's over the years and they have always worked very well, so I felt confident that this portable drive would do the same, which it does. My biggest surprise is that it works just as well on them, which still use Windows XP, as it does on my newer laptops with Windows 10 and 11, respectively. All my computers automatically recognized the new drive and no setup was needed, which was a real pleasure. I have every expectation that this 2T drive will stand the test of time as have the internal ones I've used in the past."
603,1,"Defective item, cord disconnected frequently","Unfortunately none of the systems advertised could view this hard drive to even configure it. It simply did not become detectable and the cord was malfunctioning that it came with. Seagate is a reputable brand, so this was extremely dissapointing."
604,5,Good,Works just fine no issues
605,1,Bought 5T and the amount of space is NOT 5T,I always buy from Seagate and have for over a decade. I've never had problems in the past.The most recent purchase in July for a 5T drive is not letting me transfer memory card images as it says it is out of space.On the outside of the drive it says 5T when you look at it and on the computer it says max capacity is 602.58 GB.Make sure what you pay for is what you are getting. I am out of the return window now so stuck with a drive that says it is a 5T drive when in fact it is not.
606,5,Easily add storage to your Xbox One X,I plugged it into my Xbox One X and followed the steps to format it for use on my console. Then I was able to move data from my console to the drive. Very easy to use and economical.
607,5,Exactly what I needed,I used this to expand a laptops hard drive space to run games more effectively.
608,5,GREAT Back-Up!,Would buy from them again easily...
609,5,My son loves it!,My son was complaining about the jack of hard drive space for some of his music and gaming projects. I was able to get twice as much storage as I expected. Had it sent to him as a gift. All I can say he was highly surprised and extremely pleased thus far with the ease of use and portability.
610,5,Gift for a friend,Got this little storage device for a pal and his laptop to use for active storage. Quality and with alot of space
611,5,Awesome,It Works on my xbox1
612,5,Simple and Easy,I liked the product. It was exactly what I expected and worked that way as well.
613,5,"Great value, lots of storage...","This external hard drive came quickly, and works great."
614,5,Big Drive,Wow! Big hard drive.
615,5,2nd one,I have two of these so far! 1 for my pc and 1 for my sons playstation! GREAT INVESTMENT for gamers!
616,4,Pretty Loud,"I have used Seagate Drives for decades and have found them to be very dependable. So far, so is this one.But wow, is it NOISY. It chatters and vibrates the desk noticeably when it it reading and writing. As long as it works and lasts for years , I will be happy. But the annoying noise and vibration prevents me giving it a 5th star. I have four other large-capacity drives, including Seagates that are quite silent. Often a drive making noise like this is nearing failure, but this one is brand new."
617,4,It says 5T,"I am surprise that this one is small and light. The only think puzzle me is that it says 5T but when you check the properties on it , it says 4.5T . It could be the files that it is on the hard drive ."
618,1,worked great for a while...,"worked for over a year until it didn't, I tried everything to recover it and even format it but it's now just an expensive paper weight"
619,5,W storage system,I had it for a month and it’s peak
620,5,Buen producto,Todo OK
621,1,"El producto llego en empaque cafe, no estoy seguro de que sea remanofacturado.","El producto llego en empaque cafe, no estoy seguro de que sea remanofacturado. Quiero devolverlo...."
622,1,It will die within a year,We bought this for extra storage on our Xbox One. It stayed in one place the entire time and we unplugged it when we were not playing a game that was stored on the hard drive. It worked great until right after the 1 year warranty expired and now it will not register on the Xbox or even on a PC. It is very convenient that it quits working right when it is no longer covered. I guess I have a $100 paperweight now.
623,5,good price and drive,works just as needed
624,2,Failed after 3 days.,"I purchased this Seagate (12TB) wanting to give my other drives some breathing room. I have a 4TB Seagate currently. Although the cable on the 4TB is way too loose to keep a solid connection, I went with them again after seeing reviews of this one being a tight connection, which it was.Initially the drive performed well. It had decent speed, and setup was plug and play. After moving about 2TBs of files, everything was still solid. I removed the 2TBs from my other drive to free up space. No issues.On day 3 however, I walked in and heard a beeping sound coming from my entertainment setup. It stopped after a few minutes or so before I could locate the source. Everything checked out fine.On day 4, I heard the beeping again and quickly located it as the the new 12TB hard drive. I checked it out on the PC and the drive wasn't recognized. I tried my usual data recovery options, but nothing would work. The drive was dead and 2TBs of data lost. Luckily it wasn't anything I couldn't replace.After contacting Seagate, it looked like it was going to be painful dealing with the warranty and data recovery, 14 weeks. I opted for a quick 7-day Amazon return since I could recreate my data.I think I will go with Western Digital from here on out."
625,5,Exactly as per specs,Tech support is electronic communication which takes long
626,1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is my second Seagate external hard drive. The first one I'll take responsibility for messing up, however, this one... Ive had it literally for 9 days and in the middle of me editing it completely dies and says that I've ejected it ( which I didn't). Then it started beeping and I knew ( from my previous one) that when it beeps that is not good. The Rescue support isn't the most helpful... now all my footage is gone from the project I was working on and I need to buy a NEW hard drive when I literally just bought this one smh. I'm pretty upset because I read the reviews but thought that the good outweighed the bad.... NOPE."
627,5,Seagate Best Portable Drive,"I bought this I terabyte portable drive for my daughter so she can back up her laptop and her cell phone. A terabyte is plenty of space for my daughter. I bought a similar drive in 2019 for myself and it's still working without any issues. As a retired nuclear and electrical engineer who has used many different drives and to me Seagate is at the top of the list for their efficiency, durability, speed, and you can move it to another system for it treats it as a USB 3.0 drive overall lasting capability."
628,5,It works great!,It fit the bill just fine! Thx!
629,5,Finally good tech,Easy to install. Thank you.
630,5,Portable ssd,Works great so far had it for over a year now and still works like a charm even after I drop soda on it multiple times on accident still works
631,5,No issues,Works as expected.
632,5,Good stuff,"It is lighter than I expected! Very good quality, very fast."
633,5,Just what my son wanted,I ordered this for my son for gaming. He loves it! Just what he needed
634,1,Died in 10 months. 1 year recovery plan non existence.,Lost lifetime worth of pictures and videos. Stopped working in 10 months. Tried using different cables and connecting to different computers. Drive still not get recognized.
635,5,"Had for 4 years now, still works great!","So far, this has been an awesome product... I've had excellent luck with Seagate in the past.My nephew, who's a techie (aren't they all?) advised me to get a Solid State Drive (SSD) because ""they never crash, no moving parts"".No idea if that's true or not, but although this isn't an SSD, it's been an absolutely smooth experience the entire time.I mainly bought it to store all my photos on, since my giant Azus desktop has a non-upgradable storage of rather modest size.Thank you, Seagate!"
636,5,It works perfect with my PS4,It worked pretty well. I had to format the device before using it
637,5,useful as hell,amazing👍🏼👍🏼🤜🏼
638,1,Does not work,Product stopped working after being used for a couple months. Cannot play games downloaded to it and cannot download anything else with it even though it say space available. When trying to load a game downloaded on it it pops up with he message that game took to long to start.
639,4,Ok,ok
640,5,Great - use it for backup,"Plug, play, forget about it..."
641,5,"Great big capacity, itty bitty desk space",I've never had a problem with seagate devices. This stores all of my video processing files and takes up almost no space at all on my desk.
642,1,Useless,"Good luck un-packing this ""device.""It is TOTALLY worthless.Do not waste your time ordering it, unpacking it, and discovering that it DOES NOT WORK."
643,5,Very reliable drive!,Very easy to use! Use it for Time Machine backup on my MAC.
644,5,Best of This Size,"Easy to format, quick for backups, very dependable, outstanding value."
645,4,Nice Portable Drive,"The portable drives didn't work on my computer system, but they did work on my friend's newer system. My bad luck."
646,2,Just over 30 days in... refuses to mount (mac),"I bought this to transfer all home movies into one place. They're backed up offsite as well, but this was for rapid access and editing. As I reached almost halfway full, the drive disappeared. I restarted the mac (newer MacbookPro) and it would not come back. I checked in Drive Utility - it is greyed out and won't mount (error 0). Wasted $259 as I have to start over with a different drive now."
647,4,It’s little bit noise,"It’s huge and will get job done, the only problem is it has that high pitch noise while working."
648,5,Yes,It does what it's supposed to do
649,2,Eh,I was great and I loved it til it randomly stopped working.☹️
650,5,Love it,It helps me so much for gbs worth it
651,1,Amazon customer service is horrendous..,"This item arrived and it's loud.. With my TV off it is by far the loudest thing in my house and I can hear it from the other side of the house.. I've worked in IT for 25 years and it's been a couple decades since I heard a hard drive this loud.. I contacted Amazon to return it, and instead of being able to drop it off at a UPS ship point (and sending me a label to do so), they want me to bring it to a UPS drop point (where they box it up for me) to 'avoid having so many trucks on the road'. The nearest UPS drop point is over 20 miles away! so me driving 40 miles, wasting gas and an hour of my time is better than a truck swinging a street over one day to pick this up, or providing me a label so I can drive 2 miles to drop it off?? this makes sense.. customer service was little to no help in this.. I spent over 2 hours trying to get someone that could authorize a standard pick up or drop off. Why is this a thing?"
652,5,"Small Size, Small Price, Yet Tremendous Memory Capacity","I like the small size, and large memory capacity. Replacing a previously failing HD with this little guy really improved my computer wake-ups and restarts."
653,5,Ok for now,Small. 2tb good for ps4 slim I got my games down loaded fine. This is all I’m using it for so we will see how it holds up.
654,5,Computer filled up,"With my computer full of downloads and pictures, it was time for external storage. Very easy to hookup and dump backups, pictures and whatever you need moved from your computer."
655,5,So Far So Good,"This is the first Drive I've bought (if you don't count flash drives, except for external storage for my PS4, which seemed to auto-format). When I plugged it into my PC, heard a very soft whirring sound, and felt subtle vibration, like a fan spinning inside. It's very feint and I cannot hear it from my desk (my PC is on the ground).When I clicked on the new (F:) Drive, it showed 3 files. I clicked the one named ""Start Here"" and it walked me through formatting the Drive. Since I use a Guest account on my PC (for added security), I could not format it, and had to log into my admin account instead, which worked just fine.While reformatting it, it took me to a menu for a 1 year free tried for Adobe Creative Cloud, which has several free video and photo-editing software programs, including photoshop, which is nice. I didn't expect this, but I'm familiar with photoshop, since I used it in high school and do need photo-editing from time-to-time, so I will actually be using it! I'm interested in tinkering with the video-editing program as well (I believe it was called Premier Pro).Note: I did not need to add a credit card for this trial! It seems to be an actual free trial with no string attached. Neat :)I'll update this if anything goes wrong with it, but so far it seems to work properly, as intended. It displayed the storage available in GB, the number seemed about right."
656,5,Perfect Hard Drive,We buy these hard drives for all of our on the road salesman.They are very reliable and easy to use.
657,5,Great case,The only thing that would make this case perfect is if it had a fan to keep the heat down while I use it outdoors. I'm a DJ and sometimes I have gigs outside and it can get pretty warm...
658,2,Waste of time and money,"Normally, I value Seagate drives. This one was nothing but a nuisance. Bought as a backup drive, it would periodically spontaneously unmount itself and then become unavailable to the scheduled backup. I erased and reformatted it which made no difference. Caused way too much time lost. I'd never buy another one."
659,2,This drive is the slower than molasses in January.,"For backup, this drive is fine I guess. But if you have large files that you need to utilize on a regular basis, do not buy this. It'll feel like waiting for a 3 mb jpg to download in 1995. Very frustrating."
660,5,disco duro,ok
661,5,Easy to use. Holds a lot!,I thought it would be hard to use but its really easy. Love the convenience of it and how little it is. Its not bulky and its pretty lightweight.
662,5,This is very good,This thing is very compact and small enough for portability. It can go into any pocket in your luggage.
663,3,I don't like the cable,"I had the hard drive on the couch and it had the cable plugged into it, and I accidentally leaned on it and I had heard something snap.I bought a new cable but now the hard drive only works part time.Partly my fault but I also think it's a cheaply made product."
664,2,Struggles to do the most basic tasks,"This hard drive model just can't seem to do any heavy lifting. Transferring more than a handful of files sends it reeling, and the transfer rate constantly crashes to 0. The worst problem, though, is that files (dozens, if not hundreds, depending on how many you're trying to move) just disappear when you want to move them from another HD or disc. It's like the hard drive does just enough to show it's operating but then quietly doesn't do all the work. For a device marketed for its efficiency and security -- totally failure all around. Another terrible Seagate release."
665,5,Seagate is extremely reliable and lasts a long time.,"I am always pleased with Seagate drives. It’s sleek , lite and durable. These drives are built to last!"
666,5,Backed up all my filea,"Easy to use, waa able to back up huge content."
667,5,A great drive,This is a great drive - I replaced a previous drive that was starting to go bad (9 yrs old). Easy setup . I have been using the drive about 4 Mos and have had No problems with it.
668,1,"Worst Hard Drive I have ever owned, don't buy","Whenever I import files from my brand new Mac Studio computer to this hard drive it causes my computer to crash! I've never had this problem with any other drive. While it is importing files it makes the loudest noises I have ever heard and shakes my whole desk, it is the slowest hard drive I have ever used, I can't work on files from this drive at all.I've owned tons of Seagate Drives and they have all worked great so I trusted this one would work fine too but it has been a nightmare and I am out of the return window so I guess I'm out of luck"
669,1,Closes out constantly,I love sea gate products I use the hard drives all the time. However this is not worth it at all. I got this because my computer disk space is always critically low and doesn’t allow me to do what I use the computer for so I got this hard drive to work off of and it closes out on me at least 15 times per work load. And it’s very inconvenient. I’m not sure why it does this to me but I’m frustrated to say the least!
670,1,Doesn’t work with Mac. I want to exchange it!,"I bought this product because it says it was compatible with Mac. It only works with windows. If you want it to work with Mac you will have to download and special app which need to pay a trial to obtain. I ordered and immediately went on vacation, so unfortunately I wasn’t able to open the product until I was back a month later. Is there a way to exchange this product for one that is fully supported by Mac? I feel like I wasted my money T_T"
671,1,Returned.OCTOBER 2022 STILL WAITING REFUND. DONOT PURCHASE HAVE NOTIFIED AMAZON. ULTIPLETI,"Didn't work. Still waiting on refund from January, 2020. Have proof it was returned..Still waiting on my refund. Haven't received it. AMAZON HAS BEEN NOTIFIED MANY.TIPLE TIMES.O RESULT. IT ISOCTOBER 14 2022.Still no response. Upping my requests to DAILY QUESTIONS. AND REQUESTSJUST OUTRAGEOUS!!!"
672,5,Storage is great!,I like the extra storage
673,5,Llego el que pedí perfecto,Buena compra
674,5,Perfect,Compact and easy to use.Very happy 😊
675,4,Connectivity Issues,"If you’re connecting using an attachment for a MAC without an USB port, be cautious of a loose connection. My computer keeps popping up with a message that says the external hard drive was disconnected even though it’s still connected."
676,5,EXCELENTE COMPRA,llego rapido y en excelentes condiciones
677,1,I bought Seagate by accident.I forgot how horrendous they are with Apple Computers,This has not worked since they day I got it.Unfortunately I was doing a lot of traveling at the time and when I was finally home for a while it was too late to return it.Never buy Seagate hard drives.This is now the second one I have that is worthless.
678,4,Good.,"Everything is amazing with this, however, the tech support is trash. Not gonna go into detail but there are multiple other posts with the same problem.Amazing packaging too, nearly threw it at a wall because I thought it had clamshell packaging that are annoying to open, but no, just some tape and nothing else."
679,4,Works for me,Lots of storage space for me
680,5,"Nice, quick external drive",I use external drive to backup Astrophotography videos.The can get rather large and I get good transfer speed with the USB3 ports.Some drives throttle down midway through large transfers but these drives usually maintain a high transfer speed.This is my second purchase of this model.
681,5,Great for its price,"The hard drive is light and portable, not the most durable, but I just store it in a pencil box to keep it safe. It’s great to use between Mac and PC due to its exFat formatting compatibility. Recommend!!"
682,5,My son said I Should Buy This to be Safe,"I bought it because my son suggested it, as the computer he gave me years ago, is on its last legs. He copied my stuff and between Carbonite and this device, I don't have to worry."
683,1,Not Great,"I got this to give myself some extra back up storage for my work and files on Google Drive. A few observations and comments:1) The drive is loud and makes a lot of screeching noise even when it's not in use.2) I tried to load up a very small folder (12.3 MB) and it just hung up mid process. I have NO idea why this is happening.3) Had a lot of difficulty with the drive not being recognized from time to time. Again, no idea why this is happening.While the 16TB of storage is tempting if you're looking for something to dump your files into, I'd say this is not worth your time or money as it seems to have a lot of problems. Do not buy."
684,4,Good storage capacity,I liked it when I bought it is pretty big as compared tonew storage. Runs pretty good but the transfer rate is low connected to a usb 3.0.
685,5,Efficient,"Bought this to do backups with (something I've never done), and it's quick .Happy with the product!"
686,5,Good price and value,Great value and price
687,1,LESS THAN ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASE THIS HD IS DEAD,"I bought this item on August 26, 2022, and on September 20th it died. I tried using a HD dock to get it to work ... nothing! I was using this as a backup HD so luckily, I have all my files back in California, but I'm in New York, so now I must find someone who can recover all my files from this worthless piece of junk."
688,5,Go with the Brand you know.,Once again Seagate Knocks this out of the park. This drive is reliable and easy to use. It's not compact and does require a power source.But overall I'd definitely recommend this
689,5,Use these daily and weekly for back ups - no issues,I've had these about a year now and no issues for our small office backups to date. We use about 2TB of storage on each for onsite and offsite backups. The offsite is carried and stays in the protective case I purchased separately and neither have given me issues (knock on wood).
690,1,Garbage,This gave up on life ONEweek after purchase. Absolute JUNK.
691,1,I lost all data in the drive just over a year.,I bought it Dec 2020. It's dead completely in early 2022. No recovery tool could bring back anything! I bought and used close to 100 hard disks. It's THE MOST unreliable drive I ever got. The length of warranty reflects its unreliability. You should use this drive for temporary storage only and won't hurt if it dies anytime.
692,5,So worth it,I bought this so I could attach it to my PS5. There really isn’t enough memory on any consoles nowadays. With all these new games coming out and there are massive download size it’s almost essential to have a portable hard drive. so worth the money in my opinion if you play a lot of games
693,5,It works,It works
694,2,Inconsistent,"These drives provide inconsistent transfer speed; sometimes when you plug it in it moves files quickly, other times slowly (20mb/s or less)"
695,5,Great memory,Super useful!!!!!
696,2,On time,Broke lest than a year stop working lost all my music
697,5,Very Happy With this EHD,Very happy with this EHD!It is easy to use and is great quality.
698,5,Compact and effective.,The device is small/compact and can almost fit in a shirt pocket.
699,5,It is a great product but I did not get the full 1 terabyte in my storage device,
700,2,Files getting deleted,I took out all my pictures and saved it in this hdd but boom only few I can see now... I lost some of the most precious life moments
701,3,2T = 1.8T,Only has 1.8T of usable space
702,4,"Large, ok fast, a little loud","It is a bit loud and it might take a 5-10 secs once it’s going off. I like that it saves power and the transfer rate is fairly good. But got an additional 5tb ssd which requires like 10% of the space, (see photo) energy and is completely silent. Really just for back-up"
703,5,Love this,"I needed an external hard rice for my Mac in order to play the sims since it takes up so much space. I read reviews saying that this product would have some difficulty connecting to the computer since the computer may not recognize it. I did not have that issue, I plugged in the hard drive and was able to use it immediately. I am so happy I bought this."
704,1,Don't work for ps5,Isn't supported with ps5
705,5,Perfect for Content Creators,"I purchased this item for bulk video clip uploads. As a content creator, it’s important that my hard drive writes fast and is portable enough to travel with me. This device is perfect for the “on-the-go” content creator or those that need to store large files. Makes for a great computer file back up system as well."
706,5,Great,Price
707,5,Works for ps5,"Works great for my ps5, holds tons of games and opens them quickly."
708,5,It does what its supposed to do.,It's fast amd it holds everything I need it to.
709,5,Great product,"It took me awhile to figure it out, but once I figured that I did not need to add to my Time Machine since I wanted to back up a few apple devices I had into the hard drive it was easy! Recommend this product !"
710,5,Great HD!,"I'm so glad that I switched all my files over to this portable hard drive. Not only does my machine run faster now, all my files open quickly!"
711,1,"Got it on November 2020, died today September 2022.",I didn't move this thing at all. Stored unused files on it as backup. All of the sudden it disappeared off my PC's file list and it soon became the reason my PC hangs until I disconnect it. Everything on it is now inaccessible. Worthless.
712,5,Big help,This storage drive helped my PS5 a lot with storage. You can easily transfer games between the hard drive and the console and eases the storage stress
713,5,W’s,W lil thing
714,5,ok,ok
715,5,"Extra storage, never get bored!","I love the 2TB storage! I have the original xbox one and it works well other than 2 times it didn’t work which may have been because it wasn't plugged in all the way. My xbox now has 50+ games downloaded from the storage, including big GB games like MW, Cold War, GTA, RDR2, R6 Siege, all of em with plenty storage left over. You name a game, I probably have it thanks to this!"
716,5,Great for our home security cameras,Easy to hook up and use
717,5,"Very nice, small and portable.","I have been able to transport it in the pocket of my backpack. It’s so lightweight and portable. I hope it lasts me a long time, because it’s a very easy “plug and play” device."
718,5,"Awesome ,easy to use....","Awesome easy to use ,must have for any gamer...."
719,5,Be very delicate with it,"Any bump, hit or drop on this can easily break this since it is a delicate hard drive, as any hard drive is... so just be wary of that if you purchase this"
720,1,Totally unusable and can’t return.,Unreadable on my macs. Just fine on Linux. But no matter what I do I can’t get it to read on Mac. I’m out the cost of the disk.
721,1,Piece of crap,I loaded my entire movie library on to this drive and it died in three months. Soooo disappointed!
722,1,not use able longterm,"works just fine but, after like 3 months of use I was unplugging it and it ripped the female USB hole out(for lack of better terminology but I meant the accepting end of a micro USB plug I hope this helped elaborate)"
723,4,Sea gate 1Tb,Overpriced even though it was on special for Prime Day.
724,4,lots of space for all that old data,lots of space for all that old data
725,1,Worked less than 2yrs,"Worked well with both my 2019 and 2014 MacBook Pros. Perfect for shuttling between office and home. But it has stopped working.It started a few weeks ago suddenly not allowing me to write to it. I checked permissions and it wouldn’t allow either MBP’s to change permission. Then it would only give errors when I tried to run disk utility. I decided I’d just erase it and start fresh since it was always a backup disc… Nope. It won’t even mount anymore.Such a sad state of technology. I have firewire drives from the 90’s and 2000’s that still work. Have half a dozen 5-10 yr old Western Digital drives that simply won’t die, but EVERY time I get one of these portable drives they never last."
726,1,Wasted money,"Bought this on December 2, 2021 and it was fine for the first 4 months. It was purchased for my son's Xbox one. After 4 months, it no longer registers that it is connected to the Xbox or even a computer. Tried to contact tech support but never got a response."
727,5,looks good works perfectly,i try to register with app which is coming in hdd getting closed not able to register and packing should be more safer with bubble rap
728,1,Really?,"Not sure how they’re able to sell this.Tried using it on an Xbox One. Worked great for about... 7 hours of play time?Not the move, whether it’s PC or console, gaming or photos.Shows up in a generic cardboard box, odd initially, but now I fully understand.Save your money."
729,1,Died on 2nd use,The hard drive made a squealing sound and died after the second time I plugged it in. Don't store valuable documents on here without a backup!
730,5,Seagate for the win as a Time Machine backup!,"I was a little hesitant to order due to mixed reviews concerning Time Machine backup. I ordered this as a same day delivery as I needed it quickly and it arrived promptly. It works with a Mac computer for backups, but it does requires very little reformatting. I got it to work with no issues at all. I’ll try to explain below in hopes to make it easier for anyone else having this issue.When I first connected this hard drive, my MacBook recognized it, but once it tried selecting it as my Time Machine drive, it didn’t work right out the box, and it ended up not showing up anymore. So I’ll try to explain how I remedied this.First you will want to open up ‘Disc Utility’ from the ‘Applications’ folder. From there, you will want to select ‘View > Show all devices’ from the top bar so that you see all the drives. Select your Seagate drive and hit ‘Erase’ (if you are setting this up from a new drive this shouldn’t be an issue since you won’t have any files on it anyway and this is the only way to format it). When filling out the info (this is very important) you will want to name your drive correctly with the following information:Name:ExternalHHD (or whatever you choose)Format:MacOS Extended Journaled (USE THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS ONLY BETWEEN MAC COMPUTERS).*OR*ExFAT (USE THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS BETWEEN BOTH MAC AND PC COMPUTERS)Scheme: GUID Partition MapHit erase and you should be good to go! If you have any issues after formatting it as ExFAT, follow the same steps by formatting it as a MacOS Extended journal, then go back and reformat again as ExFAT afterwards. No idea why this even works but it does (as it happened to me).Now if you want to use this drive as 2 drives you can. I set up my 5TB and split it so that 2TB is dedicated to Time Machine Backups, and the other 3TB is dedicated to my normal documents and files. You would need to partition this using disc utility as well but I recommend a quick YouTube search to better explain that part."
731,5,Works,Works
732,4,Still works after a few months of daily use,"It works. I like it. My only request is that it should come with a rubber sleeve. The bottom likes to slide off my desk. The added grip and cushion would be nice, and isn't uncommon on these portable drives."
733,1,worked for a week,Died after one week.
734,5,My Seagate external hard drive,"I got what I ordered in a decent time. The storage was what I wanted. Portability is also what I wanted. I plan on using it for photo's, and to save items from my older computer. Might be enough storage at 5Tb, will see. Great price for me. Thanks!"
735,5,Gaming,Thanks to this product it’s super easy to hook up and make comparable to my ps4 to play more games 100%recommend
736,5,I love this portable hard drive,"Formatted this hard drive to efat, using my laptop.Now I can plug it directly into my android phone.Using the file manager already installed on my phone I can create folders and save files to the portable hard drive. Then I remove them from my phone to save memory"
737,5,great invertion,lo mejor del mercsdo en mi opinion
738,5,Not the size I expected,I like I can store a lot but we sh for location it was bigger physically
739,5,It’s great.,I’ve tried smaller version for the sack of being cheap but as the saying goes; “you get what you pay for.” Those I kept having problems with. This one has been handling the job wonderfully.
740,1,Difficult process to get replacement when drive fails,"After two months, there was a constant problem with the drive not backing up properly on my MAC. Several phone calls were made for tech support and only one technician seemed to understand the MAC. Several had no idea of how to resolve the problem and seemed unable to access past records. The problem has never been resolved.It's necessary to return the drive before getting a new drive, unless you are willing to pay an additional fee, and there is no guarantee that the information can be recovered. It's been a very frustrating experience."
741,5,Great external hard drive for extra storage capacity,This hard drive stores my computer’s time machine data and transfers are much quicker than my previous hard drive
742,1,NO funcionó,"La unidad no funcionó, a veces Windows la detectaba y otras veces no, la trasferencia de archivos era muy lenta, se demoró una eternidad copiando un archivo menor a 1 MB. Tuve que devolverla y pedir el reembolso."
743,5,"Simple and Amazing, gets the job done.","I play video games a lot and don’t have enough storage on my C drive, so I bought this. Works amazingly, games load just as fast. Compatible with Steam, Epic, Xbox, etc. Basically anything. Can download whatever games I want now :). Makes a little bit of noise (white noise) when it’s running/when unplugging it but not really bad, can only be heard if your input sensitivity is all the way down. Will also tend to get a little warm while downloading but nothing too bad. Storage is authentic, none of that fake storage stuff. Can take it to school with me or literally anywhere because of how small it is. Overall really great and good price for amount of storage :)!! Would recommend if you need more storage for gaming. BTW - Drive shell is made of what looks like thin plastic, so be rather gentle with it, especially in bags with heavy items."
744,5,"AWSOM !,","Fast delivery, very good comparable price, product is very fast.What more could you ask for."
745,5,Do you need an external hard drive???,Yes........and it's worth every penny.
746,5,Cheap and Easy,I used this for my ps5 in which i was running out of memory. It really helped a lot by expanding it more . It’s easy to use and anyone can easily connect if you running out of memory
747,5,Just what I needed for my new MAC Studio,"This nice large 4TB drive makes a great backup system using Time Machine for my new MAC Studio.Setup and use was more than simple, and Seagate has a great reputation for reliability and support."
748,2,Don’t waste your money,"I’ve had this hard drive since 2019-2020 when I purchased it on Amazon. The drive stopped working recently, mind you it’s not even a quarter filled up. It connects then disconnects. I’ve tried everything but none of the solutions on the sea gate website have worked. I checked the warranty on their website and apparently mine expired around the time I purchased it in 2019. Which is honestly probably part of the way they scam money out of you. They make you pay to recover your files.I have a Toshiba tb that I’ve had since like 2017 that’s still working and it has more files on it.Don’t waste your time on a hard drive that will stop working. You can even check YouTube and see the plethora of videos of people complaining about the short lifespan of the product."
749,1,Bricked itself in 24 hours,"Just Google Seagate Beeping.This one did it 24 hours after we started using it.Then, no computer we tried to use it on - 3, in all - could even find it.Put a bunch of irreplaceable photos on it, and they're all gone. Thanks, Seagate!"
750,5,Hope,The media could not be loaded.
751,5,It is very useful.,"The capacity is good and also operating speed is fast. It is also good value, affordable. I will buy one more."
752,4,Bought two,Ive bought two of these for different friends and neither of them have complains not that I would let them. They where both able to install games and play them with no issue. All you really require which im not sure if it comes with the hard driveis a high speed cable .
753,3,Does not work with latest mac updates,have to send mine back. does not work with latest mac updates....though im sure its a great drive for pc
754,5,Works year after year,"I have several Seagate external Hard drives and this one, like all the others, keep working year after year. Whether it's for movie files or photography files, these external storage devices are a must and even 5TB fill up quickly. Plug it in and it's ready to go , couldn't be simpler. Most importantly, they last. Do wish they would come down in price, but I find it's better to go with the larger size, the 4 and 5 TB than the smaller ones as resolution on videos and photos drive up file sizes."
755,5,Highly recommend,Great product.
756,5,Works without a hitch,"Fast, reliable access. Nice price point."
757,5,Great price,I like the storage space
758,5,Nice drive,Works exactly as intended.
759,2,Not impressed,My son bought this for my husband for his bday as I got him a new PS5 and knew he’d need extra storage. It allowed the games to download to the hard drive but now it says it’s not recognized and won’t work. After purchasing in advance for a bday and now I can’t return it I’m highly disappointed.
760,5,Great portable hard drive,Great hard drive
761,5,Great device! Lots of space for anything you want to upload to it.,Great brand & safe product.
762,5,It works amazing just isnt the full 4 terabytes,It works amazing and is a great external harddrive for any needs!
763,5,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive,I use it on my computer saved me a lot of storage
764,5,buen disco,Tal com se muestra en la foto. buen producto
765,5,Definitely Worth The Price,Fast Shipping And Product As Described
766,5,NICE UPGRADE FOR MY BACKUP SYSTEM,I bought 2 of these 5TB drives and now have all my data mirrored from all my pc's dating back to 1995.Took some real time to copy and paste all that data but my live is much easier than juggling with minimal storage sizes in the last year.
767,2,Stopped Working,This was a good drive until only 2 months after i purchased this device it stopped working completely. I’ve tried everything i could like order a new cord or resetting my computer but nothing has worked so I’ve lost my files stored on there it is really frustrating.
768,5,Works like a charm,"Line this, works perfectly"
769,5,just right,"this works great for my ps3 . only play a few games , so i'll probably won't run out of space on this for a long time ,"
770,5,Does it’s job,"It’s fantastic, so much space, great for storing games and really anything else you’d need."
771,5,Great Drive,Works very well. No issues. Highly recommend
772,4,Good disk for backups or storing large amounts of information.,"This disk has the capacity that is expected. Despite its large capacity, it does not get hot. When it starts to work, it sounds like a squeak but it stops right away, I guess it's when starting up. I use it to store media for an Emby server so it stays on for many hours and works fine.It is quite heavy so it is not intended for portable use from one place to another."
773,1,Will be corrupted and unreadable,"Worked great for a couple of weeks, before completely breaking and now it fails to even be read by windows device manager. Does not appear in the devices list most of the time, when it rarely does, attempting to access a file on it shuts it down, disconnects it, and temporarily disconnects all attached usb/bluetooth devices. Terrible purchase and terrible build quality from prior Seagate drives. All data on it is now unrecoverable. DO NOT PURCHASE."
774,4,Works as advertised,The 2Tb HDD works as advertised i was able to condense my data from 2 smaller older 1Tb HDD’s one that was failing into a single 2Tb HDD I highly recommend this drive my only complaint is it’s 5400RPM but that’s to be expected from a USB HDD
775,1,NOT FOR MACS!!!!! FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!,"What a joke. It says compatible with MACS with a reformat. Maybe if you are a tech genius. But if you’re an average joe following the instructions online, you will hit a brick wall like all of the reviews claiming the same thing. Bottom line: If you have a PC? Have at it. IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS PRODUCT FOR A MAC, YOU WILL BE RETURNING IT AS SOON AS YOU GET IT."
776,1,Used Hard Drive,"This was already configured for a Chrome Book, I had to reformat to work with my Mac"
777,5,Fácil de instalar y utilizar,Me gusta mucho y lo recomiendo es de alta calidad
778,5,excellent,easy to use
779,5,Can't beat it.,Well made and it is as advertised.
780,5,Fast delivery!,Storage capacity is amazing! Paid for what I got! And love it!
781,5,Works great with my PS4.,I use it all the time.
782,1,DOesn't work on my MAC,It does not work on my Mac. A real nightmare.
783,4,Perfect,Item worked perfectly right out of the box on both windows and Linux.
784,5,Drive,It does what it’s supposed to do.
785,5,Best,I have used this brand repeatedly and it has always been reliable
786,5,Used for 2 Years no problem,"All my friends bought hard drives n they’ve all broke, this one out lived all of them so i highly recommend, i even bought my brother one and no issues at all."
787,5,Works great,"Very simple, fast, and effective. Highly recommended"
788,1,Cord slips out very easily and very upsetting.,"I'm very upset cause the cord that comes with the seagate is very weak, it's not firm and slips out all the time, this makes it hard to do anything."
789,1,Issue with connection,"The issue is the connection with the computer. Only after a few months, I found this issue. In the beginning, I thought it might be the problem with my laptop, actually, it still exist when I switched to a new computer. Most of the time, it's very hard to read. I have to stop using it in case losing my data. Don't buy it!"
790,1,IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR DATA GET A SOLID STATE AND NOT THIS,"Huge mistake with this hard drive. Lost everything I've done over the past year. Sent drive into Seagate and customer service is well intentioned but feels about as solid as this hard drive. Anyways cutting to the point, sent it into Seagate for data recovery, and it was unsuccessful. I don't know what to tell you, maybe I'm part of that 2% that doesn't have a good experience with data recovery. Maybe Seagate is great. But I'm traumatized. So back to my title statement, regardless of the company, IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR DATA GET A SOLID STATE AND NOT THIS.UPDATE - From Data Recovery that's costing $1000 in response to Seagate's team who worked on data recovery for my external drive > ""Im not sure who worked on this drive, but WOW! I haven't seen such carelessness like this in a while. It's really unbelievable.IF Seagate is the only person that worked on this drive, I am honestly speechless. This case may have had a chance at being recovered, but now it's tough to say.""If I can sue Seagate, I will."
791,5,"Does what it needs too, easily.","Bought this because Final Fantasy XIV was taking up too much space on my laptop and I got tired of the low storage notification, lol. It was a pretty simple plug and use. I hope to have it for a long time!"
792,5,It’s great,It’s great I have nothing to add
793,1,Don't buy!,"Very bad HD, Keep freezing my PC , waste of money."
794,5,"Great for the price, works flawlessly",nothing to dislike( issue with apple time machine taking time preparing backup.. maybe because of size 3 times what I had before). used to backup my Mac Studio. Haven't called tech support yet.
795,1,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE!,"They say this is compatible with mac, but it is NOT!"
796,5,IDk on tech support never needed it but it stores everything great and easy to use!!,Good
797,5,Good hard drive 5/5,"Does as advertised and is compact, around the size of a folded wallet."
798,1,Died at 28 days,"Died at 28 days, what more needs to be said."
799,1,Worth it if u don’t move it a alot,Connector is garbage. Hardly stays in after a year of use. Pretty sure the product I got was a discontinued model bc I can’t find it on actual website. Slow speeds.
800,5,Just what my son needed,He says it’s great
801,5,Recommend,I was able to combine 4 portable hard drives that were full to this one drive with plenty of room to spare. My only complaint is the backup software that comes on the drive is limited.To really use the backup program as intended you need to purchase the complete program. To me that is deceiving.
802,1,Technical problems,"After less than a month, my storage device stopped being able to be detected by any PlayStation. You can connect it and the device will be on but will not be read by any console."
803,5,Cable Bent Easily,"The cable connecting the hard drive to a computer bent while in my back pack on a trip. Not the highest quality. Also worth mentioning, it’s a very odd and specific cable so it’s not as easy as going to Walmart to get one."
804,5,Its Seagate.,Buy it.
805,3,"Amazing drive for simple use, not a great use for high-end programs.","If you are using this drive for basic use such as just simply storing files or even for school and whatnot it's perfect, BUT I will tell you from experience (~1 year with this drive) if you are a video editor this is not the drive you are looking for. In my experience it has made After Effects much more slower and more likely to crash, you should invest into an SSD or NVMe for such high-end work. Just thought I would warn others since I have already wasted my money from poor research efforts a year ago LOL!"
806,5,Very Pleased with this product.,"Great gift for College Student,he is really making full use of this."
807,5,2 Tb’s ext hard drive,"Plug and play operation with the Xbox one....loads/saves games just as fast as the internal drive , maybeeven faster.."
808,5,Need to include formatting steps,If you have a Mac you need to go through some formatting through the disk utility app in order to be able to use this. At first I did not think it was compatible until I read some of the reviews. Seagate should send a page of formatting instructions or at least a website of where to go to format the disk.
809,1,Bad power supply,"Packaging intact, opened the drive and the power supply was dead, no power output. Renders the drive useless unless I buy another one or return this one and wait another month to get the refund and repurchase."
810,5,Outstanding device.,"I liked the compact size, the light weight, the ease of use, and the appearance!No negatives at all."
811,5,900 gigabytes,"Product is really good, has around 900 gigabytes works well for my ps4 & ps5, I recommend buying this product if your all ways low on gigabytes"
812,1,GARBAGE!!!,"Purchased in May, 2022--it's now Sept 2022 and this thig is a paperweight. Won't mount, and makes a rattling noise when plugged in--never moved--never dropped.Pure junk.Do not buy!"
813,1,Doesn't work with Macs,Not compatible with MacBook El Capitan
814,4,Good hard drive but,I bought this not knowing it doesn't work with a PS5.. oh well. Still works as it should just not what I bought it for.
815,5,"Nice unit, nice proce",Everything works fine - no issues.
816,5,good,good
817,5,Less lag time than actual PS4 hard drive.,I used this for my PS5 to store and play PS4 games.Super pleased with simplicity of use and quality of loading and playing games
818,5,I bought it for my PS5,"It didn’t take long for me to set up , it was easy to format , it didn’t take long for me to transfer all my games on there , the time it took tocopy back to the PS5 wasn’t long either. To me this is more easier on my pocket to buy this hard drive then to by in internal one ."
819,1,Junk don't waste your money,Don't waste your money.2 months old and crashed.Lost all my data.2 months worth of work.Will never buy another Seagate product.
820,1,Product stopped working,"Received the product June 15 2022, and it worked ok until August 25 2022. I used it to back up my photos and it was never moved from my desk top computer... it was not dropped or else... I do not understand what happened."
821,5,Works as described,ZERO COMPLAINTS
822,5,Good product,Everything is fine except there's no pouch box included!
823,1,Doesn't work,Won't load up to put files in
824,1,GIGANTIC POS,"I thought this was a good price for a good sized storage - F)@#*ing thing does not work, computer sees it but cannot access it in ANY way - won't accept files, folders or ANY media - cannot even start a new folder - DO NOT BUY these damn things.What a waste of money. And I was dumb enough to buy two."
825,5,Buena calidad,Excelente precio
826,4,Yesssss!,Worked great!
827,5,that it is great,great
828,5,Worked straight away for mac book pro 2017,Plug and play for mac book pro 2017 and time machine use as was preparing for clean install to get to OS Monterey in Sep 2022. The drive just worked out of the box to complete time machine back up. Overall we followed apple guidance after our 2017 mac book pro did not have enough 'space' for the upgrade so had to do a clean install. We are tech aware but still it takes a leap of faith and a lot of web reading all the same. This Seagate drive made one part easy if that helps anyone out there.
829,1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!,"I bought one of these for manual backup. It was just what I wanted so I bought another one to use as a Time Machine backup. The Time Machine backup failed after I updated my OS; the drive became locked. I thought it was my fault because of the update. I still liked the drive so I bought another one. I have my backup located in an inconspicuous place so didn't notice that this drive had failed completely in time to return it. I just tested my manual backup and it is now also DEAD. So I have wasted $300 on these very flaky garbage drives. They all set up with no trouble; and they didn't travel, they just stayed in one place with no wear and tear. I tested them on another computer; same dead drives. If I could give them negative stars, I would!"
830,1,Not even an option on my Mac,"There was only a setup for Chromebook or Windows. I watched the help video that was titled something like ""can't access the external hard drive on my Mac"" and I still could not utilize it. The hard drive showed up as an icon on my desktop, but I could not use it. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but I plugged in my old, smaller hard drive that I've never used on this computer and it worked right away."
831,5,Good for the money,Great value for the price
832,5,good,Very practical
833,2,Not 2TB - Only 1.8 TB!!!,"this feels hollow and cheaply made. The listing also claims this is a 2TB storage holder, but it’s only 1.8 TB"
834,5,Great,Does it's job.
835,4,Great drive for the money but needs a good backup software.,"This is a great little drive for the price but it's lacking Decent backup software. There are much better backup programs out there both free and paid, but was expecting something a little better software wise to be honest."
836,1,Is not compatible with Mac,Bought this Drive to store photo’s for my photography business but it is not compatible with newer Mac software. When i went to download Seagate Mac software it told me the manufacturer has not made a software for New Mac Software yet. Waste of $61
837,2,Didn’t work w my Mac,Says works with Macs yet I couldn’t format and gave up and returned. Liked the size and portability of it tho
838,5,Great buy for the money,Does the job at a great price. Portability a major plus. Very pleased with purchase.
839,5,great for storing pictures,great for storing pictures
840,5,great item,does its job and doesnt look terrible siting on top of my system
841,5,Easy to use,Just plug it in to the USB port on your computer and you're ready to go! Easy to use and makes me feel safe in making sure I don't lose important stuff
842,4,Priced right,I feel my other 2TB Seagate that I purchased at Costco was a better product but I purchased that one two years earlier . I'm sure prices have gone up since than that withstanding If I was to purchase another onetoday I would pay to have the identical one I had it is a better model than this one.
843,1,"If you have macOS, DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE","I received the product on time and was able to connect it to my laptop immediately but I found out that the disk is READ-ONLY. Why the heck would I buy a read-only disk? To read an empty disk? Apparently, you need to purchase additionally a different product, paragon or something, to work with mac because the disk came formatted for windows. In the process of ordering, I was never alerted to this possiblity. It is also weekend and of course I cannot find any support because the seagate support is monday to friday 9-5. I am very angry. I need to download some files urgently and now I am stuck having to purchase another product. Terrible experience."
844,4,Worked OK,"Purchased this device to storage Insta360/GoPro/DJI video for my Alaska motorcycle trip.. been through few rough sections with strong washboard and million of potholes motorcycle was shaking a lot in these sections.No issue with device.. but the only problem is that if you accidentally disconnect the device (it seems to be sensitive if you move the USB cord tad bit it disconnect) then device will take up to 40-45 minutes to ""repair"" before reconnecting and if you accidentally disconnect it again then it add another 40-45 minutes to 'repair'.Annoying and frustrating but I found a way to prevent it from happening again I didn't have any more problem transferring videos/photos and disconnect it properly ejecting it from MacBook.Last few sentence is why I am giving it 4 stars because it is sensitive to disconnect."
845,1,Very slow to copy files,Very slow to copy files
846,5,Works great with Dish Hopper 3,"We bought this to copy our movies from our Dish Hopper Sling before our Hopper 3 was set up. It took a while to copy all the movies, but it works great!"
847,3,Don’t use for gaming!,"I used this for game storage for my Xbox series X, I put all the new gen games on my Xbox and all the other games in the hard drive.However, the hard drive has crashed multiple times, closing out my game in the middle of a match. Would recommend another hard drive than this one."
848,1,The WEAK LINK is the PROPRIETARY CABLE!,"I bought two of these.... The drives are fine... the cable is proprietary and is the weak link.The USB connector is fine... but they add some funky double mini plug on the drive side which is loose and loses connection... ON BOTH DRIVES!I ended up ripping the drives out of the box... and they are fine -- and interestingly, in my case,less expensive than buying the drive alone.Go Figure.Be WARY of the cable."
849,5,I like it,Good hardware. Very easy to use.
850,5,"Light weight, Holds tons of storage!",I got this for my PS4 because I needed more space for my games and applications. Once you get it set up it works wonderfully! 10/10 recommend!
851,5,Drive 10TB,Good amount if storage and good for storage or back up for your files.
852,1,Does not work with Mac Power Book Pro M1,"Failed after 3 months. Constant ""Improper Ejection"" errors triggered by computer or screen going to sleep. This is a known issue and I followed all the suggestions to fix the problem on the Seagate website, but none of them solved the problem. The drive eventually failed, Mac Disk Utility could not fix the drive."
853,1,died after less than a year,10 months in and its dead. its been sitting in one spot.
854,1,Transferred all data to harddrive. A few days later it died,Harddrive died. All pics are gone forever. Went to geek squad for a data recovery but they charged $1500. Better to store everything in the cloud
855,1,Failed-Out of warranty,Unfortunately for me this failed about 2 months after the 1 yr warranty.Fortunately for me I didn't need it for a rescue and will be buying something more reliable.
856,5,Love it,"Does as advertised. I’ve got 1.81 TB storage, and it’s therefore rounded to 2 TB which is my only criticism."
857,5,Fast,Quick to process and small.
858,5,Great product and copies fast,Love everything about it great quality at a decent price will definitely buy more
859,5,Can’t beat hdd affordability,"Runs fast for game, videos and files. I use this for all around storage. People say ssd is better but I say only in some ways. Ssd has a higher fail rate than hdd if you want to keep your files safe for the long run use hdd if you want short term high performance use ssd. I use ssd for my immediate work but I use hdd for my long term work haul and reliability. They are best used together."
860,5,Portabilidad y rendimiento,"Excelente calidad, portabilidad y rendimiento."
861,1,Duro 1 semana,Se daño en una semana.
862,1,NOT A GOOD CHOICE,The disk broke after very ligth use.
863,5,Easy to use,I only needed to plug it in through The USB port at the front and restart the PlayStation and it connected perfectlyI’ve been using it for around a week now and downloaded many games and still have more than 60% of storage leftI downloaded many large games such as NBA22 Red dead battlefield and other 80+ and 100+ GB games
864,1,This drive did not work,The drivedid not work upon arrival in spite of calling support which was also challenging.
865,5,Great bargain for the amount of storage.,Great price for 4TB
866,5,Storage,It holds a lot in the storage
867,5,Is working fine,"I waited a while to write this review to see if any problems cropped up.Not a one.This has been very fast, reliable backup.Highly please with this drive."
868,4,Hard to set up but awesome,"I have purchased multiple.Awesome product but is not read immediately by any gadget.Need to install software in order to read which is a hassle but with it for the data it holds.Great product, very sturdy"
869,1,DO NOT BUY: seagate lists warranty as expired MONTHS before I purchased product,"Worked like a charm until the day it didn't, less than 6 months after purchase. So I contact seagate. Drive is dead. And out of warranty. Data recovery? Well see the warranty expired in January 2022. Two months before I bought what I was told was a ""new"" drivein March 2022. How is that possible? I have spent so far an hour of time with seagate, plus another 15 minutes or so with amazon trying to get to the bottom of it. But, as I told both of them, this isn't a me problem, its a you problem. I regret this purchase very much.Update: sea gate has decided that my product is still under warranty. Perhaps it’s because I told them that not giving me what I purchased is called fraud. I now have to ship drive to Seagate for attempted data recovery. They give themselves 30 business days to do this. Rather elaborate packaging instructions. Fingers crossed. Still regret purchase."
870,5,good,good
871,5,Pretty great for the first time,This is my first external drive I’ve brought and it works pretty good. It can store big gb games and it has no problem with me uploading videos and projects onto it. Just make sure to safely eject the drive so it don’t corrupt the data. 10/10 item
872,5,This is why I stick with name brand technology!,I previously ordered a no name brand and as soon as I picked up the package I knew it was going right back!Lesson learned.I immediately went back and purchased my Seagate Portable 1TB External Storage (like I should have in the first place) and it is exactly what I expected!Moral: Don’t Cheap out if you can help it. Your time is more valuable than that!
873,1,2 years and dead,"I can't believe I wasted money on this and it's dead a mere 2 years later. No drops, no damage. Just so frustrating. I relied on this product, spent the money hoping for quality, and it failed me. My lame Passport WD still works. Looks like I'm getting more of those. Will NEVER buy Seagate again"
874,5,Quiet and performant,"Haven't had it long but so far so good. I like the quietness of this Seagate drive compared to my Toshiba and WD Passport externals. Writing large files to the drive is hitting 140MB/s consistently at this time, and reading large files is in the 125MB - 130MB range. Copying many small files is significantly slower as is to be expected with mechanical drives. If you're accustomed to SSDs and haven't used a mechanical drive before, keep in mind that drives like this are much slower than you are accustomed to. What you get in exchange for your patience with these drives is more terabytes for your money.For any critically important files, be sure to back them up to multiple places, including cloud storage if the content is not sensitive. Harddrives fail, both mechanical or SSD. You should always consider failure a matter of when not if and prepare for it accordingly."
875,1,Doesn’t Work At All,"This is a piece of crap! Won’t let me transfer anything onto it, which is funny BECAUSE THAT IS ITS SOLE PURPOSE!!! Don't waste your money! Returning!"
876,5,Best for the price! Maybe better!,I’ve had this for a little over a year. I use it for my Xbox and it makes no noise doesn’t get hot. Cords fit snug into drive and usb never falls out actually have to unplug it(I’ve had it fall off the table and it stayed on the cord. I use my Xbox none stop it’s pretty much on all day everyday! Buy this it’s way worth the price tag
877,5,Great drive.,"Seagate is the leader in this field, and this drive is an example."
878,2,Tech Support/Warranty service difficult,"Worked fine for a few months. Then would freeze running and get VERY hot to the touch.Tech Support and Warranty claim very difficult. Never did find a phone number all by email.Submitted screen shots of diagnostics, etc. They concluded manufacturing defect.Then wanted me to ship it back for their testing at my expense....then got a pre-paid shipping label after complaining. There was an option to provide Credit Card and get quicker replacement...I declined.Finally after several weeks they shipped me a replacement.In the meantime, bought a Western Digital to maintain my backups while Seagate fooled around."
879,5,Pleased,Just what I needed
880,4,Reformat for Mac,"If you are hoping to partition this for a Mac, you’ll need some tech experience. Otherwise, it will seem like it doesn’t work. If you don’t know how to reformat an external hard drive, watch some videos, read some articles, find a friend, or choose a different product."
881,1,Doesn't work,I got 2 and they both don't work on my xbox or my boyfriend's xbox tried it on the laptop that didn't work either
882,5,Cost & size,"GOOD QUALITY ITEM, FAST SHIP AND GOOD PRICE FOR THE VALUE."
883,1,Wennt from 4TB to 32gig and lost my backup,I don't know why it did it but it was backing up my files just fine and just recently it went from 4TB to 32 gig for now reason I can find.None of my other hard drives have done this.DON't BUY
884,5,Sturdy thus far,"I always get nervous with large drives as when they fail, there is a lot of data to be lost. I am currently using this as a backup drive and so far I haven't had any issues with it. I only plug it in about once a week to update any changes and what not but never had an issue with it."
885,1,Terrible,stopped working after 10 days
886,5,Reliable,This hard drive is a great tool. I was first introduced to it through a friend and I’m glad I made that decision. It fits a terabyte like it says and I can’t really say I’ve had any problems with it. Thank you seagate for making a wonderful product
887,4,plug and play baby,easy to install and use
888,5,Great Storage for Series X/S Games,"First, we should all know by now that with a few exceptions, there is no way to play Series games from any external drive, not even from an SSD for those wondering, but we CAN play games from all previous Xbox consoles from an external drive.I read so many reviews on so many drives prior to purchasing this one. Did I purchase this one because it has the best performance? No. I could’ve purchased an SSD with a much higher write/read speed but I would’ve gotten a fraction of the storage at a much higher price. I decided on this HDD because at $164, the dollar per TB is almost impossible to beat and with how I intend to use this HDD, the performance is more than adequate. So, I write this review in hopes that it’ll help someone else decide whether this drive is for them.I read so much about read/write speeds when researching HHDs and I got to thinking, the read speed for a lot of us will be more important than the write speed. Why? Because our internet’s download speeds will max out way before the HDDs write speed capability is maxed out. So here is where the read speed comes into play. If you use this drive to store all your games, including Series games, and copy rather than move the games to the internal drive, then you’re only “moving” your games in one direction, and it just so happens that copying from this HDD to the internal drive is very fast. I copied Jedi: Fallen Order, Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 from the HDD to the internal and they copied at a pretty much sustained 1.5Gbps (187 MBps). At 103GB FH5 took no longer than 15 or so minutes to copy. To me, a 15 minute wait is totally worth the savings/storage you get vs an SSD or dare I say the $400 2TB expansion card!!! At this price point I think it’s hard to make an argument against this HDD.I don’t know if the read speeds will be impacted as the HDD fills up so I will update the review once I’ve had more time with it. On a side note, the drive came in a generic cardboard box which I was not expecting. Don’t know if that means anything but nonethelessthat’s the way it was shipped."
889,5,perfect for personal and some work use.,"Works great, feels great, looks great. light weight but not truly pocket-sized. Portable? Definitely. One very minor thing though. the cord used is very different than what im used to so if i were to lose the cord id need to buy a replacement or the product is rendered, useless. other than that, just dont lose your cord and its exactly what you need for an extra terabyte of storage. i bought 3. dont ask"
890,5,Worked,It worked perfectly with my fiancés Xbox x didn’t have a problem
891,5,Works with Dish receiver,"Works with Dish VIP 772k dish receiver. The owners manual recommends an HDD with external power, but it works fine."
892,5,Literally just a hard drive,It’s a hard drive
893,5,Hasn't conked out yet,It's been a few years. Still good.
894,5,Muy satisfecho,Muy satisfecho
895,5,Great for backups and pictures,"I know have 3 of these Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drives, and very happy with them. I have concerted all of my 8mm and video tapes to mp4 files using these drives."
896,5,"functional, great storage!",love seagate products! haven't had any issues yet and i definitely have lots of storage for my large video files!
897,1,Unit died after 5 weeks,"My Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive died after only five weeks. Lightly used and never abused, it went dark with no warning. Caveat Emptor."
898,5,Get this one if you want a long life on it,I’ve had this drive for over 5 years now. I came back because I am buying another one. My old one is full but still working fine. This is far superior to other drives I’ve tried and I learned the hard way that not all hard drives are equal.
899,1,Stopped working after 6 months. Lost my job,Gave out after 6 months. Lost 6 terabytes worth of data and now IM FIRED. Thanks a lot. Lost my job over this unreliable junk of metal.
900,3,I didn’t even get the full 1 TB,I just didn’t like that I didn’t get the full 1 TB. 😐
901,1,Device is not compatible with MacOS according to Seagate website.,The description is false.
902,2,Was not compatible with my MacBook Air.,"I tried all solutions to get my files to transfer to the hard drive but nothing worked. It claims to be compatible but it isn't, and I saw some reviews that said it was but nope. Just fyi."
903,5,Perfect,Best item so far
904,5,Perfect for what I needed.,"It was exactly what I needed! It was perfect for me, I needed to expand my laptop's memory, and this was what I needed."
905,5,Great product,I just got it today and hooked it up and it works also comes with a cable
906,5,Sencillo y practico,Me gusta lo compacto y fácil de usar
907,5,As expected,Worked perfect to add storage for a PS4.
908,5,Best for xbox series s,It offers way more space than what you would originally have definitely worth the price
909,5,Very good.,Best money I spent.
910,5,Good product,Works as described.
911,5,Great hard drive,"It bit heavier than the 2TB, but the transfer is quick. Love it!"
912,3,It DIED within 24 hours,"I prefer WD over Seagate but I'm not that picky. My parents have this drive as a backup drive and it is quick and reliable for them. So I bought this. I intended to use mine to extend my laptop capacity for every day file swapping. While unzipping content to it, it got very warm then died. Not even my mighty Linux box with tools could get this drive to be recognized. Back to Amazon it went the following day. I think It's a good drive to backup to once in a while. It's not up to the task of everyday use for me. I do use Segate drives for my NVR cameras and other desktops and they are generally very reliable."
913,5,Storage,Works really well with my laptop
914,5,Great device;performance is great. I already have two .,I already have a couple of Seagate portable devices. Have had them for number of years.
915,4,Good basic backup drive,"Using this as an external backup drive.The only thing I do not like is that you cannot download the ""toolkit"" to make it more user friendly.It is more of a basic strip-down backup drive."
916,1,Do not buy if you have a MAC,This does not work with a MAC computer.It does not work like stated in description.
917,1,I,I ordered a 2 TB but they send me a 1TB. Other then that it works on my ps4.
918,5,Excellent backup drive.,Excellent external hard drive.I have several of these.I use one for information and file portability and one for my computer backup.No problems with either.
919,5,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD,Product is as described. Downloaded pictures and movies with ease.
920,1,Didn’t work right out of the box,Completely defective. Replaced with a WD.
921,1,Unusably slow,"Seriously so slow that it was unusable. I sent mine back, and by the way, returns aren't free even though it says they are. Don't buy."
922,5,Awesome,amazing
923,5,Helped save so much storage,Genuinely helped us save so much on storage and it’s great to have a place where you can keep old files that you don’t want to throw away
924,5,Excellent!,"So far this has been a great drive! Very easy to use, fast and reliable! I have usually used WD (and still do have 1) but after one I got around Xmas last year failed after a couple months I decided to to go with this one and glad I did!"
925,5,It works with Xbox series s.,"If you like to play a lot of games on Xbox and if you brought the low priced Xbox S console like I did, then you gonna need to get extra storage space. I brought this storage device and it works well. It is best to try to figure how much space you need before buying though."
926,5,"Good price, easy to hide.",My wife found my old portable hard drive that I stored all my pornos on and she barbecued it. This one was a good price and I think it will be easier to hide. I just wish I had all my old pornos…
927,2,Capacity on drive box is a lie.,Bought this drive stating that it's a 16T drive. When I got it. Its only has 14T of capacity Now i am very much aware that you do not fuy get the space you buying.But its a completedifferent story while you a full 2 Tirabyte short.You are not getting what you paid for.. see photos
928,1,Broke within a week of having it,"This harddrive was a gift for a friend for his birthday and he had plugged it in and used it for about a week. Come to find out after turning off his ps4 and turning it on the next day, he had the screen of ""cannot connect to harddrive"". Tried to unplug it and reconnect it through settings and it just stopped working, no light, cord wasnt broke, just stopped working. I was too busy to get it from him and return it and i missed the due date. It worked fine then completly failed, dont buy this."
929,4,Good but can't get new games,New games need faster storege so u need to move games from internal to this to clear space for newer games other than that it pretty great
930,5,Lo recomiendo 100%,Muy bueno pude poner todos mis juegos ps4
931,5,Buena calidad,"Luego de mas de un año el disco funciona perfectamente, uso regularmente. Sin quejas, buena compra"
932,4,Works for MacBook Pro,Worked out of the box with a MacBook Pro
933,3,Not what I wanted,I really didn’t know the one I ordered had so little memory available. I overwhelmed it immediately. I don’t know how to figure how much I have to how much I need. They could be a little clearer in the description ( like can store up to 2 hours of video)
934,5,Love the extra storage,I design my own embroidery patterns and love having the extra space to store them.
935,5,Good productfast backup,Great easy to use 5 T storage.connected quickly and backed right upthanks
936,4,Great deal,"Easy to set up, huge capacity.Easy backup software available."
937,1,Lies. It's not even ps4 compatable,I got this thing for my PlayStation 4 and it literally wouldn't even work on my console the PlayStation couldn't even format it. Get the one that actually has the PS4 logo on it that's the one that works
938,5,Fast and Stable,Keeps every photo and video I take.
939,5,Ami hijo le encanto,Ase buena funcion
940,5,My nephew is very happy with this product.,"Arrived on time, works great."
941,4,Excellent product,"I have taken to storing all my large game files, videos and pictures on external. I had this for about 2 years and it still works like a dream. No lag in startup, no over heating issues and haven't had any loss or degradation of data. It excellent quality for money and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another even in a higher RPM to use for gaming."
942,5,Great storage device,It is able to hold up to 2tb which is a lifesaver on a PS5 since there’s barely any storage. 10/10 product
943,5,It was exactly what I was looking for,It was what I was needing & looking for
944,1,would not work with my Mac,it will not work with Mac lap book. I plug it in and try to save and the message came up saying that it will not work with word and excel on a Mac.I have always have used Seagate for saving and my Mac is on Intel and not on the new ones.
945,1,Confounding.,"What would it be like to just plug a hard drive into a computer and put files on it? We'll never know. So many registrations, hoops, compatibility issues to jump through. Abject lunacy."
946,1,Will lock you out,"This drive changed my permission to ‘read only’. I could not add files because I was blocked from ‘read and write’ permission. The fix is costly, requires IT skills, and you could lose valuable files. I discovered complaints of people who lost important files, luckily the drive locked me out before I could add these types of things."
947,5,"Something to be said for ""Old School"" !","I may be old school, but my digital information and family memories are safely backed up with this external hard drive. I don't fully trust the efficacy of online storage (cloud storage and the like), and having the added assurance that we have our important and sentimental digital items safely stored is worth any expense."
948,5,Great hard drive that does its job,"I purchased this hard drive to store and play PS4 games on my PS5, and I haven’t had any issues with it yet. Though it was a little disappointing that only 5.5 out of the 6TB of storage it has is usable, I don’t have an issue with it since that’s still a lot of storage I have.The hard drive can transfer games and files at a speed of around 150 MB per second, which was a decent improvement from my previous Segate 2 TB hard drive at speeds of about 60 MB per second.For $120, I would say that this product is definitely worth the money. I may not use all of this space, but I do feel that it’s definitely worth it since this hard drive feels and functions perfectly for what it’s being sold for."
949,5,Works Great!,Works Great!
950,5,No technical difficulties,Served as storage and it had enough room
951,2,Not actually 2 TB,"I purchased the 2 TB model and was disappointed to see that it only had 1.8 TB. This may not seem like much of a difference to most people, but this is aggravating because that’s 200gb that I paid for and didn’t receive."
952,5,Good,❤️
953,1,Doesn’t work,Wont work with PS5. Waste of money
954,5,Great device,The device has all the storage I need to keep my 1000's of photographs safe and secure.
955,2,Not auto formatted for apple,I tried to use this to back up pictures on my iPad but it shows read only. I am unable to format this on my iPad so I will have to try formatting it on my ancient windows laptop.
956,5,Very portable and useful,Very durable and portable. The speed is ok but it does its job
957,1,Doesnt work on new macbook air,Very dissapointed to buy this and not work on macbook air
958,2,Hassle for me,"Should be plug & play.Have a different brand 4tb external I wanted a bigger drive got this yet locks up my windows 10 or won't let anything load on start unless I unplug it.Tried trouble shooting on website &Google.Everything I tried doesn't help.So to use it I have to unplug it then plug it in after windows boots.So it works,just not how it should."
959,5,Extra Storage,"Nice to have extra storage for photos, videos, documents or just anything needed that takes up a lot of space."
960,4,Liked it so much that I purchased another one.,Unluckily its the biggest one (capacity) in this size. So I have several of these ones. I prefer this one to the WD ones.
961,2,slow read and noisy with copy issues,"This is my second large size storage drive. My first was Western Digital it is quick, reliable and quiet. This took 4 days to copy my 7 T of data onto. and it failed 8 to 10 times in the process would just get a read/write error and would need to shut it down and restart it. It's noisy which I find to be very distracting and because of the read errors I wonder if I can trust it."
962,1,Not compatible with macs,The title of the products says that it works with macs.But in fact does not.Unfortunately I threw the original box away so I can't return it. Now I have a $60 paper weight....
963,4,Works well.,We bought this to supplement the HD space on a PS4.Works beautifully.
964,5,Photographer must have!,No problems with them!
965,5,Fue lo que esperaba.,Me funciona perfectamente.
966,1,Lies,"This does not work on a Mac. I purchased the drive far in advance for photography work and when I plugged it into my Mac it is not compatable. There are a series of instructions to format for mac, but they do not work. Don't purchase from this vendor."
967,1,Very poor directions and no Apple laptop pro connections. Wireless weakness.,Worst product from Amazon recommendation. Apparently cloud is best way to save data. Don’t throw away box like I did.
968,3,Disappointing,"I've bought 3 of these 5TB hard drives and two of them have ended up making that clicking sound and not being recognized on my computer. I haven't had either of them for even 4 months before they started doing this. I'm very disappointed because all my projects are on this drive and I can't even access them, and I shouldn't have to pay extra to take them and get fixed. They should be reliable when all they do is just sit and stay connected to a computer"
969,5,Dependable and Portable,"I bought this Seagate external hard drive to replace another that was about 10 years old.I've had this one for about a month now and, as expected, it works perfectly.I use it to back up my laptop using Time Machine."
970,5,Goes great with gaming consoles,Went perfectly with my Xbox Serie X. Just gotta format it and you're set!
971,3,Video game hard drive,Crashes sometimes. Use it for Xbox one storage
972,1,Not Mac compatible,"This advertises that it works on Macs. It doesn't. It's formatted for PC. It claims you can plug and play. Nope. There's no launcher icon. It's plugged in, light is on the unit, the Mac can see the Seagate Drive, but no way to actually use it. Time Machine says, ""Backup Disc Not Available."" I have restarted the computer. There's no phone number for Customer Service, either. The 'tech support' is a link to a pay loaded with advertising.I'm deeply dissatisfied. I have had Seagates before, so wanted to replace with the same because they'd worked well. Not anymore."
973,1,"HD always empty, need to format always!","The media could not be loaded. I like watching movies so I put some on my hard drive but it’s always empty whenever I try to watch. It always doesn’t work properly so I need to format it every time. I’m very disappointed with this, the quality is low."
974,2,The Har Drive keep crashing.SHould have bought a stationary one.,THis drive keeps crashing with only 3 TB of data let alone the 12 tb it can supposedly hold. I may have lost all my data already.
975,5,Reasonably priced and very reliable 5TB drive,"I have an IT background and storage is reasonably priced. I remember purchasing a 250MB drive many years ago and I can now purchase a 5TB drive for about the same price. That's 20,000 times the storage for the same price. The reliability is also much better but probably not 20,000 times better.This drive is very quiet and I use it nearly every day.I always find a way to fill up a drive these days with ""stuff"" so this drive came in very handy. It was delivered quickly by Amazon and it was my second purchase of the same drive.The SSD (solid state drive) equivalents are still far more expensive for 5TB so I'll have to wait a while for those prices to drop down enough to make them usable for large storage purchases.The drive worked right out of the box and everything about the drive is solid. For the price, this is a very good investment.Just remember that spinning drives probably have a life expectancy around 5 years or less.You should think of backup software and a cloud backup system if you believe your information is valuable."
976,5,Excellent product,As advertised
977,5,Small & Compact,Works great for use as a portable storage device.
978,4,Works fine as a back up drive,no issues to date.
979,5,Excelente!!!,Excelente!!!
980,1,not long life,Became corrupted after 4 months of use.
981,2,"Storage is only 1.81 TB, and read/write speed is almost 90% slower than advertised.","Storage is only 1.81 TB, and read/write speed is almost 90% slower than advertised. The product seems pretty durable, but the specs are not as advertised."
982,1,Dead,2 years and it has completely died out of no where.
983,3,Not easy to use,It wasnt as durable and the disk doesn’t operate well. Its hard to locate in the laptop so have to plug it in and out.
984,4,Worked on All My Devices,Seagate & WD get a bad rep until you try something else. Beware of small 16TB drives for $150. They don’t work and lose or corrupt your data. I got this 5TB for about a hundred bucks. It’s reasonable fast and was recognized by all of my devices (don’t know about Mac). You lose half of one TB to operation and I wouldn’t fill it over 4TB as these drives failure rates increase close to full capacity.
985,1,Bad Deal,"Received HD in timely manner. Due to surgery didn't try to use for 1 month. When I contected it to my wife's computer this is what I found. There are no instructions, no quick start guide. no app, not anything but instructions for a Apple backup. I needed a backup for a Windows computer.. Also while searching this drive found malware. Waste of time and money."
986,5,great buy,I wanted something to keepmy files on while I will be able to access from other computers. It also saves on my computer memory.
987,5,Blackbox coolness,"So far just started to use it today to backup my files, so I can wipe Lenovo computer and install Linux distro"
988,5,Great Product,"I’ll start with the good points of the hard drive. It is very easy to use and access files in. For Mac users however, you’ll have to go through some extra hoops to get your device reformatted entirely for your Mac devices or have them compatible between Windows and Mac devices. I still recommend this compact external drive but for Mac users, be aware there are a few extra steps involved."
989,5,Excelente producto,Recomendable.
990,5,Very good thank you,Love it
991,5,Perfect for me,"Light weight; portable.I use it more as a ""backup"" to my ""backup"" files."
992,5,Its contains a lot of space.,"Product is as good as advertised, if not better."
993,5,Thumbs up!,I bought it to expand the storage of my Playstation 5 and I have had zero issues with it. Would buy again!
994,5,Works great,This is my 2nd Seagate external drive. They work reliably and fast
995,5,Good Quality,I insist on good quality and I got it in this hard drive.
996,4,Fast and easy and a little risky,The external hard drive works really well. I haven’t had any issues with it.Edit: so if you’re planning to use this device on a PS4 or any device that does not have an internal battery. I suggest not using it during a storm or else a blackout can damage the hard drive. Most devices repair the drive for you but it’s still a risk of losing your saved data.
997,5,use with my ps5,"it works great as storage for my ps5. stuff loads fast, its quiet and works great."
998,1,"NOT compatible with Mac OSX. False advertising, Amazon. You suck!","NOT compatible with Mac OSX. Total waste of time. Thanks for more false advertising, Amazon. You suck!"
999,5,BEST purchase!!,This is the perfect Terabyte system for my games and my Xbox! Love this!
1000,5,External Hard Drive,Working great so far. Bought one for the Xbox and one for the wife's MacBook.
1001,5,Just what I ordered,So far it works perfect
1002,5,Plug n Play,"Great hard drive, super easy to use. All I needed to do was plug and start downloading games. So far no lags when playing."
1003,2,Began failing after 15 months usage. Just past the warranty.,Worked great until it didn't.Couldn't access a file. A scan showed one sector bad and about 100 beginning to go bad.Won't but another.
1004,1,Not writeable for Mac,"It says it works for Mac, but it's read-only. Um, would be good if it said that. Returning."
1005,5,Amazing external drive,"So I bought this for extra space on my Xbox one and I’m not gonna lie but the product has been amazing and haven’t had any issues at all, the whole thing is smooth and honestly love having more space for a good price. I totally recommend this if you’re looking for more space. 10/10 for sure"
1006,5,A must have for storage expansion,"I was looking for a cheap, high capacity storage solution to backup and move some files off of my main two disks, and this drive does the trick. With 10 FRICKIN TERABYTES, you'd better not run out of space. Granted, the RPM is slow at 5900, but I'm not using it for anything highly demanding. Plus with mechanical drives being dirt cheap per GB, $212 for it minus tax is a STEAL. I remember the first external drive I bought that was 2TB. I got it for $80. And this one is from Seagate, so I consider that very reputable."
1007,1,Not MAC compatible,"From the description, I took it that it was compatible with my MAC.It was not. and it's too late to return it."
1008,5,Sleek and fast,Transfers are super fast. I did about 15 Gs in 12 minutes or so. Pretty good brand!
1009,1,Didn't even last a full week,"Formatted for Mac and backup everything just fine. Two days later, won't mount and disk repair can't repair it."
1010,1,Does not a work on ps5 games!,Showed up pretty quick but thats about it. I bought this for ps5 game storage and turns out u can't store ps5 games on it.
1011,5,Muy buen precio y calidad,Es un precio justo por este producto y posee buena calidad.
1012,1,Is already dead!,"Do not buy this drive. I am using it for backup only, no heavy use or anything, and last night it died on me. I am trying to recover the files and the computer is telling me ""is going to take 22 days"". A bunch of warnings and stuff. Terrible cheap drive."
1013,5,IT BRICKED MY PS4,It bricked my playstation and now the storage device don’t work at all. Thanks a lot!
1014,1,DOA,"Completely dead on first plug in. This is the not the first Seagate drive I've had die on me, but it's the last one I'll ever buy.Garbage."
1015,1,NOT FOR MAC -- False Advertising,Ad says it's for MAC but it's not.Don't buy if you're looking to back up your Mac.
1016,3,Misleading description for Mac users,Very misleading description as the drive has to be re formatted for a Mac. Problem is they provide NO instructions how to do this so you are left on your own to look it up. Luckily another Amazon reviewer kindly detailed instructions just very recently in the answered questions section and it worked. The company should be better however at making this obvious to all customers. From other reviews one can see that many did not figure it out and were left frustrated...
1017,1,Drive failed in less 3 months,"After only a couple months of use--using only as a backup drive--it failed. I have to force quit the drive and when I reboot, I get multiple messages that the drive was not disconnected properly. On top of the fact that the drive does not work after so little time, I have to pay to ship it back to Seagate in order to get it replaced. I would not buy this again."
1018,4,Tricky Setup for the Unclued (MAC OS),"Would be neat if the Portable came with instructions for us less than tech-savy, plug n' play types, (and a USB-connecter). My MacBookPro didn't recognize Portable. Several tries later it did, but click response (attached) was a Start_Here Win.exepage. Assumed I had a Windows-only unit, but prowled around. In System Preferences, saw the TimeMachine icon, opened it and disabled dysfunctional previous backup drive, selected the Seagate Portable, (which of course, has to be connected). Was never prompted to register-no privacy issues other refer to. Backed up 32GB in 40 minutes. Could have done without Windows reference thing."
1019,4,As advertised,Works well. Does what was expected and still has plenty of storage available to add new.
1020,5,Just needed some backup storage,It worked as advertised.It's for simple backup.
1021,1,"no directions, won't work with my Macbook Pro","This product needs to come with directions and an explanation of which computers it can work with. I followed directions from Apple Community Support to reformat it to be able to interact with my Macbook, and they didn't work. I've spent over an hour on this - ridiculous and disappointing."
1022,5,Good product,"Nice small size. The connector cord seems like it could go bad as it isn’t the most flexible. If you are doing a lot of traveling with it, you may want to be mindful of how you store the cord."
1023,1,ONLY one year warranty,"The 5TB HDD external worked perfect for 2 yrs. Than it went dead. The computer could not even recognize it. Tried 5 other HDD's. and they worked fine. But not this one. I tried to feel the motor but NO sound. Meaning it was broken internal.I called Seagate today. They said, ""We only have one yr warranty! That sucks. I will not will buy another Seagate HDD.Beware and Bewise when buying Seagate HDD's."
1024,5,Awesome! Thanks,Awesome! Thanks
1025,1,Awful,"I've bought this exact external hard drive twice, and it failed to work within 24 hours both times. That's over $100 down the drain with nothing to show for it except two broken bits of equipment. Any other brand of external hard drive will give you a device built to last. Don't buy this."
1026,3,Very Noisy Even When Plugged Into Powered off device.,"Very Noisy.Even when plugged into a powered off Xbox, this thing grumbles and is loud when idle.Very bothersome. It’s also only 12TB of total use."
1027,1,Worse 10TB external drive for MAC,Purchase this for video storage. Not user friendly. Hook up is weak connection if the connection wires move Drive will disconnect. Super slow to connect to MAC. Not compatible with MAC programs.
1028,1,waste of money,It stopped working and no tech support. It is a company from China.
1029,5,"So far, so good.","So far, I just use it for backup but it has worked well. Anything changes, I'll update."
1030,1,Died in less then a year and was hardly used,Was using this on my Xbox Series X (which I rarely played). Kept on to it and used in my computer for a very short time before it died.Had this thing less then a year and was hardly used before it died.I understand drives die but for this to happen to a drive that was hardly used for less then a year is not acceptable.Don’t buy this drive and don’t by Seagate.I know I won’t ever again.
1031,1,Defunct after 6 months,I essentially just made a backup and never used the drive again. After trying to back up other files the drive became unreadable midsession and is now unreadable on several machines.
1032,1,Falta de Informacion,"Con mucha espectativa sobre el producto.La realidad:Si cumple1- Tamaño pequeño y peso ligeroNo Informaron1- Valocidad super lentan inferiro a 30megabytes/segundo2- Realmente no es 5tb, con las justa llega a 4.5 tb3- Garantia en años 3, 5, no dice nada4- Vida util en dias o horas, no dice5- Vida util en tb, no diceCarece de mucha informacion"
1033,1,Dead after 4 months,"I bought this hard drive 4 months ago, the storage capacity was great and it was pretty fast. The reason it's only getting 1 star is because it is dead now."
1034,5,Funciona,Muy buena lo tengo conectado en mi PS5 y pues me ha ayudado en guardar varios juegos que tenía en mi PS4
1035,1,Stay AWAY from this Drive,"This drive uses a Barracuda ST8000DM004, this is a SMR drive, which is a technology very makes this drive totally unusable for intensive data purposes, yes, you can write your data, but it may take you FOREVER, I have 100% Active time in my computer hours after writing or reading, this slows my whole system, terribly.Don't believe me? See my screenshots, I'm migrating all my data to a WD also, external drive, same capacity.Do yourself a favor and look for Linus Tech Tips' video on youtube about this called ""Why are Drive Manufacturers in BIG TROUBLE?""And guess what, this drive has ONE YEAR warranty, of course, now I know why!!Once again, for your own peace of mind, Stay Away from This effing Drive!"
1036,5,Perfect,Can't get better than perfect
1037,3,Good…freezes a lot.,Decent hard drive for the price. Freezes up fairly often while gaming on Xbox.
1038,3,"Great storage, slow transfer","For the price it’s worth the shortage, but beware - you can’t use it as an active device. The process and transfer speed of the device is significant. If you’re a photographer and use Lightroom or photo mechanic, it makes the programs inoperable. Again worth the money as a passive storage solution."
1039,5,Outstanding reserve GB reserve tank.,Outstanding reserve GB reserve tank for my PS4 games which is short on GB’s.
1040,5,Quality Product,Didn’t rate tech support since haven’t needed to use. This is my 3rd purchase of a hard drive from Seagate to use with different computers. Seagate is always my go to for reliability and dependability.
1041,1,Would not work on my MacBook,Would not work on my MacBook
1042,5,Great,Perfect size; easy to use; light weight
1043,5,Great for storage,Son likes his gift that he asked for. He said it has excellent storage capacity.
1044,5,GREAT STORAGE CAPACITY,STILL WORKING GREAT
1045,1,Not as advertised,Advertised to work on PC or Mac but only works on PC.
1046,1,The thing takes forever to start up so I can access my files and too risky to lose all your files,I will request a refund because this product looks used and malfunctioning.
1047,1,Trash,"Literally used this product once to backup a laptop computer and than kept it in my office drawer. Attempted to use it a second time and kept making spinning noises and would not connect to my computer. Unbelievable, worked one time and now out $100+ for this."
1048,5,Works well,Works very well
1049,5,Excelente,Excelente
1050,1,Lost all my games,It just stopped working. I had all of my games saved onto the drive to protect all of my data. I lost everything and all customer support says is that the warranty is expired. Very expensive for something that won't last.
1051,5,You have to reformat it to work on your Mac,"At first, it didn't work. So I went on Youtube to find out how to get it to work before I sent it back. You have to reformate it if you have a Mac."
1052,1,The hard drive does not even get recognized when we plug it in our PC or in the computer.,"We finally got a chance to use the hard drive today and find it does not work.the light comes on, but it is not compatible with my laptop or my computer.Please refund my money.Thank you."
1053,4,How to use for Mac,"The basic format of this HDD was "" Windows NT file system"" which can use only for Windows. Changed the format to ExFAT which allows using Mac and Windows. Now I can use both Mac and Windows!At Mac: Open Finder→Go(Top let bar)→Utilities→Disk Utility→Choose HDD→Erase→change the Format to ExFAT→click Delete→complete.Hope this helps other people."
1054,4,Up to expectations,Storage
1055,4,SOLID,"Haven't gotten any problems, this chonky portable made it 5,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean & 36,000 feet up in the air 🥶Can withstand outdoor temps of 100+ FahrenheitAbsolute unit. Will try to update this review if I can once it hits wintertime.4 stars tho cus the storage capacity reading do be sus"
1056,1,No,"This was a great investment for the price. Everything was going well and I used it for work without an issue. The other day, I was using it in my computer which I have had for the past eight years and the drive just crashed without cause. I take care of it because my whole career is in it. Now no computer recognizes it and it’s going to take approximately $1,000.00 to recover everything if they can get into it. Save your money."
1057,1,i just lost hundreds of dollars worth of games because the hd stopped working,nobody can fix it if it stops working and youll loose hundreds of dollars and progress in games if it stops working
1058,5,Works great for my Xbox one,Xbonx
1059,5,Great Product Works as Advertised!,Great Product Works as Advertised!
1060,5,Used for backup,Easy to use
1061,5,As Advertised - good product,As Advertised - good product
1062,5,Perfect for space,"It's very small and portable so it doesn't take up much space at all, and it moves files fairly quick. The space that it has on it is perfect. For me it's mostly used to have space for all my games to stay installed, and its great for that. It was easy to setup, just plugged it in and it started working. Highly recommend it."
1063,1,Bad product,Didn’t even work & I couldn’t return it
1064,5,amazing!,perfect
1065,5,Great!,I bought this to transfer my pictures from my laptop so I could clean up some storage space! So far its held a lot that I needed it to and still has room! If and when I need another one I will come back here to purchase!
1066,3,Not plug and play on mac,Can not drag and drop anything on it on mac. So not plug and play only works on windows
1067,5,memoria externa,producto de calidad y precio inmejorable
1068,5,very portable,its a harddrive not much to say it just works
1069,2,Don't waste your money,Works great for a while then will just stop working. Lost alot memories and over 10 years of memories uploading to this drive . It won't connect or retrieve my files.
1070,5,One tiny issue but it’s not a problem,"This product is great, my Xbox one s has 500gb or storage and I’m only able to use 365 of them and this gives me an additional 1.8tb and I simply plug it in via the usb cable is came with and I get a notification there is a hard drive connected and you just follow what it tells you."
1071,3,12terabyte hard drive,The actual size of hdd is only 10.9 terabyte.why do they advertise it as a 12 terabyte.
1072,5,Works like a charm!,The title says it all. I’ve had it for a year now and it works wonders
1073,4,the cable falls out if you look at it funny,That's my only real complaint. I have it sitting beside my tower and the connection cable will just... fall out sometimes.
1074,5,Great product,Fast shipping. Good quality. Good price. As advertised.
1075,3,Lento,Es muy lento. Es mejor poner unos $$ extras y comprarse uno mejor.
1076,1,Don't trust this brand,"Bought this drive earlier this year, and it worked great for several months. Was even on a UPS so there were no power interruptions and there was brownout protection with the UPS. A few days ago, it wasn't showing on my computer. I unplugged it and let it sit for a couple minutes, then plugged it back in. It started clicking repeatedly, so I unplugged it again and let it sit. Then when I tried plugging it back in, it didn't turn on at all. So I thought it might just be a defective device, and ordered the same brand new Seagate drive. When I plugged in the power and USB cables, it didn't turn on. So I unplugged it, let it sit, then tried again, same result. So I'm returning this to Amazon (hopefully Seagate sees this review), and I ordered a Western Digital USB drive of the same size. Will never buy anything again from Seagate."
1077,5,compact larger storage,It has compact larger storage simple to use.
1078,2,Stopped working,"Worked fine the first time I used it. Four months later I plugged it in to back some more big files up to it and it’s not working. Loud clicking noises, won’t let me transfer things onto it or off of it. Freezes up Disk Utility (and my whole computer) when I try to run First Aid or reformat it. Blah."
1079,5,Works great for Xbox series S,"I’d assume it would work with a Series X but I can’t test that, it’s an HDD so it can’t put the X/S games on it but that’s not what I bought it for, it works well and downloads games very quick"
1080,5,Works Well,Very Useful and works as expected
1081,5,I use it for local back up.,"Local backup drive.Plenty of space, simple installation and working great."
1082,1,Doesn't work at all,"Just unboxed it, and no power gets to it. I tried 5 working outlets, no power. Garbage. Returning."
1083,5,Bad item,The hard drive holds the space but after 2 months if using it it stopped working for no reason at all. I didn’t drop it or anything the light is on so I know it’s connected but it doesn’t show up on my memoryand I don’t know why. This is the second harddrive I bought from seagate and had the same exactproblem with the first one.
1084,5,i can got it all my photos into it,"the disk is great, the capacity and i can conect it to my laptop very easy. im really happy to have it"
1085,5,Easiest External Hard drive ever,This thing was so easy I literally plugged it in. Went to setting and formatted it and done. Then all my PS4 games downloaded straight onto it.
1086,5,Great Item,I use this item to keep on my video files on and it works great.
1087,5,Used for gaming system,Bought for my son. He said it's works good and gave a lot of storage. No complaints!
1088,3,Disappointing,"I bought this because it said it has 4TB but I just connected it to my ps5 and it shows only 3.68 TB, I could have gotten 3TB for much cheaper but o decided on getting this more expensive one because it had one more TB, Disappointing."
1089,1,BEWARE buying here.,Mine did not work. Light was not on no one home. I had to get amazon involved to get money back.My brother got one as gift.Ordered 12T. The box said 12T. Paid for 12T. It was only 10T. When checked on computer.This is why say beware.
1090,1,TRASH!After just 6 months all data Lost & Unrecoverable,"TRASH!After just 6 months of sitting at my desk using it 1 time a month for file storage for 1Tb of data...it's toast! Complete failure. All data lost & unrecoverable.NEVER dropped, never even moved! Just sets there. Crap!I should've headed the other reviews that said the same thing."
1091,1,Doesn't work on mac,"When I plugged the external hard drive into my mac and clicked on the execute file, I got the following error message:You can't open the application ""Start_Here_win.exe"" because Microsoft Windows applications are not supported on MacOS."
1092,5,PERFECT,It works
1093,3,"works well, but may fail on you","It works well out of the box, Just plug in USB port.But, eventually, the backup drive will fail, from my experience. After a while --- maybe months or a year.One possibility is that becomes overheated and this causes some damage or corrupts file, or something of that sort . I am now trying to prevent this problem by either not having the Seagate external drive plugged in all the time, or making sure I shut down my computer regularly when it is not in use."
1094,5,Works great for PS4,"Works great for my sons PS4. When we first got it the file type wasnt compatible but i was able to change it and format it on the PS4 without using my computer.Takes a bit of formatting and file type management but there are youtube videos online that walk you thru it. Overall, we're very pleased and now he doesn't have to uninstall a game when he gets a new one."
1095,5,Great!,"Love it, works as it should, I am finally able to have all my games downloaded to play"
1096,5,Excellent back up speed,"I used this drive together with Acronis backup software to make a complete image of the hard disk. If the desktop also support USB 3 then the back up and restore is at blazing speed, very happy and satisfied.Note: I bought an extra *HIGH PERFORMANCE* USB 3.0 to Micro USB cable that support max 5Gbps, hoping it gave extra boost but ended up returning the cable because no change in performance compared with the original cable."
1097,5,Cool,Cool
1098,5,Just what I needed!,"Bought this to back up all my photos and videos on my Mac, over 8,000 photos and vids together and it hardly took up any storage. Had to watch the Amazon help video to reformat it first-if your mac won’t open the drive to use reformat it first-then just dragged and dropped everything. Easy to use just what I needed!"
1099,4,Good for backing up raw photos,"I use it to back up my photos. The port on the hard drive is a little weird, I wish it was a normal micro usb"
1100,5,Almost perfect…,Everything is great except when it comes to Tech Support.
1101,3,It’s not 2tb,It’s not 2tb it’s like 1.7 for that I would give it a three star but besides that it’s small easy to install obviously and it’s good but 1.7 I’m kinda mad about
1102,1,It was damaged and could not use at all.,Did not work damaged and could not use!
1103,5,Storage,I needed to backup my system and I wanted something reliable!
1104,5,Great!,Love it!
1105,5,Easy to use,Easy to use and carry
1106,1,It died after 6 months,"Bought it for backup and I had no complaints - however after 6 months of use it just stopped working - no light, no nothing.I don't know what happened. I tried it on different computers - nothing.Dead."
1107,1,Crashed after a month and can't recover data so far,It worked great as a portable HDD and then it disappeared. I can't access the data at all and the drive doesn't show up. Seagate hasn't got a tech support to help and their dick recovery wizard can't see the external drive. I'm trying to reach Seagate and will update this if I manage to get this working. I need the files on my drive for work!
1108,5,Easy to set up,Always been a fan of Seagate. Easy to set up and easy to use. Been using Seagate Externals since I was in the desert during Iraqi Freedom...Will always recommend Seagate
1109,5,Great product,Great on my system it still can download and play most series X/s games
1110,5,Works as advertised,Simple to use and a good price for the storage capacity. I am pleased with this purchase.
1111,5,Used for PS5,This product works well as storage for PS5 games and applications.
1112,5,Storage,Worth the amount of storage it has. For games and pictures
1113,4,buy,Ease and portability
1114,1,Does NOT work out of the box for MAC or PC. Don't purchase.,"While Seagate products are know for being fantastic, this isn't. Does NOT work. Not user error. Don't purchase. I'm returning this product."
1115,5,Fantastic product,"I opened it up, plugged it in, and presto it worked like a charm! Nothing more really to say."
1116,5,works well,"I have used this thing a lot. It works well. Did you know 2 Tb is a lot? It is, and this one holds that much."
1117,5,Excellent external storage drive!!!,"This drive is small (About a the quarter size of a laptop) easy to install and has seamless integration with my Windows 10 OS.It took me less than 5 minutes to connect and configure.I use it for storing backup sets, movies, music, photos, and more.I'd recommend this product to all my friends.Great deal!!!"
1118,5,A Very Good Harddrive!,Very please with the hard drive and how it works. I'd buy this brand again.
1119,5,It’s a good product.,It’s a good product.
1120,5,good price,fits good.
1121,4,AWESOME,worked without a hitch and it is portable
1122,1,Product doesn’t work out of the box,You know it sketchy when the return window closes quick after delivery. Product was sold defective and I missed the return window.
1123,5,"Disco duro de 5TB: ligero, rápido y precio adecuado.",Hasta el momento responde muy bien. La capacidad es la indicada en la oferta.
1124,5,"Small, convenient and portable",Easy setup and to use. Happy with my purchases.
1125,1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this because I needed to back up some important files and after two years there was a mechanical failure.Everything I had on it is now gone and I was told it would cost $2,500 to recover.After reading some forums it appears to be a fairly common problem.Spend a little extra and get something more reliable."
1126,1,Probably not a good buy,"Had this for four months and it's already dead.It was never dropped and in a laptop bag.It just stoped reading, make a weird wining noise.Everything I moved to it is now lost."
1127,5,Good hard drive,This is a really good hard drive. Alot of space for a pretty good price.
1128,5,always a good choice,always been pleased with SeaGate products
1129,5,Works great,Works as it says
1130,5,Seagate! What can I say,Seagate is always a reliable brand. Love their Hard Drives
1131,2,Failed after a few months!,Have had many other Seagate external portable harddrive's and this is the first Failure. Still under warranty so I hope they can recover all my thousands of photo files!!
1132,1,Stopped working in 2 months,This product is highly rated and I was so excited to use it. Within 2 months it stopped working and it will not connect to my Xbox or computer anymore. Disappointed.
1133,5,Just what I needed for a replacement,Work's great 👍
1134,5,Solid product,"Came as described, no issues 1 month in."
1135,2,Disconnects Randomly When Not Moving,"About a month into owning this hard drive it began disconnecting randomly while sitting flat on a desk and not moving. It disconnects 5-10 times throughout the day, I've tried different usb cables with it and the problem persists. Perhaps I got a faulty drive but this has never been dropped or treated poorly and is a frustrating thing to deal with while editing."
1136,1,Don’t waste money on this item,Stopped working after 1 month.
1137,5,LOVE IT,"So far, this product is nothing short of amazing. My computer was going so slow due to all of my pictures. When I pulled it out of the box, I couldn’t figure out how to make it work. I used customer support and they were very fast and helpful! It is so compact and portable, I don’t even realize I have it! Thank you!!"
1138,5,Works with backing up computers,"A lot of space for a full computer backup, it's perfect"
1139,1,Will not let me load from our Mac.,Does not work with Mac.
1140,1,should've trusted previews reviews,this worked no problem but today it just completely stopped all apps and games on the Xbox One. it read it but wouldnt open anything. purchased it December 2021 pretty disappointed.
1141,1,"Terrible, Lost all my data and games","I’ve had this product for 2 years, it got in plugged once while playing a game and lost all my data and games. I followed sea gate walk through to fix it, every option including Rebuilding my PS4 hard drive, nothing has worked. Lost all my achievements, saved games, and if you are a gamer is this like your worst nightmare coming true. Thank you seagate for selling me a piece of junk and completely screwing me over. Please never buy anything this company makes. By the way your tech ppl are also very unhelpful."
1142,5,It’s trash if you’re trying to use it for gaming,Won’t stay connected and is making my gaming system freeze bought two one worked for a year then stopped then got a new one that didn’t work so sent that back and got a different one that won’t stay connected not worth the money spend the extra money and get one from someone else
1143,5,Nice and small,I recommend it!
1144,5,This sucks so bad,"Just stopped working on day 31, now I’m stuck with this 60$ piece of crap."
1145,5,5 T,"I got gypped by a different Chinese company with an ""8TB SSD"" for around $90. Couldn't even install one game on it because the upload speed was so abysmally slow, even after reformatting. An SSD it was not. (They even had false 5 star reviews for a totally unrelated art calendar on their page.)I knew Seagate was a more reliable brand. And even though this isn't an SSD either, this 5 terries of quality cyber space is so good to have right now, that's worth pitching this commercial-style review. I've even stored and ran my first game on it. (Pics included).As for BAOGSM, may your products find their way to the bottom of a landfill where they belong. Thank you, Seagate, for giving me somewhere to put my Dingaling.Big Moike!"
1146,5,Pretty great!,I love this product but there was one flaw that kinda scared me at first I plugged it in my pa4 and it popped up an error saying it was an unknown device that could not connect so I in plugged it and plugged it back in a work so anyways awesome product just didn’t like the mini heart attack 😅
1147,5,Hard drive,I need a external drive for my Xbox and didn't want anything pricey or crazy. Went with the 2TB for my games. It holds 1.8TB which I'm still happy for the price. It was worked well and was able to download more games onto the drive right away.
1148,1,Have bought two of these and both of them have stopped working a month in,"Will not recommend this. Mine keep breaking the moment a month goes by.I barely am using them and when I finally get to? THey no longer work. the only good thing aout this is their storage and portability, but tech support was completely helpless."
1149,1,not formatted for MAC,Not formatted for MAC.I purchased the 1TB.Drag and drop does not work.There are files on the disk for win and chromebook.Nothing for MAC.The Ad reads that this is for MAC.Not true.:(
1150,5,I would buy again and again,This works great for gaming and is easy to use. This was my first external drive and I always forget it’s there because it’s so easy to transfer
1151,5,Great for back your computer,I used it as my Time Machine for my Mac. It worked great!!!
1152,5,Compact & fast,"Good price, compact & fast"
1153,1,Died after 1 month,Installed a few things and some files for my laptop and after 1 month it died
1154,5,Don’t buy,"The media could not be loaded. Faulty product don’t buy this, after a while you can’t put in the cord because the HDMI output don’t even work"
1155,5,How easy it is to set up,It was easy to set up and very cheap compared to other sellers
1156,1,Crapola,"Bought this contraption last December.In January, I started having problems with it.Now, in July 2022, I can't even access it as it's not even recognized by the computer.Very poor quality."
1157,1,12tb died quickly,"3 months, almost no usage, plugged it in today and it's dead. The 10tbs have been reliable at least"
1158,2,"Ordered 16tb got 14tb, but has CRC issues and crashes under load","I ordered the 16tb and received the 14tb model.Before realizing the size difference, I tried using it to backup files and systems and received nothing but CRC issues on the drive and BSOD due to raid issues. The drive literally goes mia during heavy load and crashes the system.I would avoid."
1159,4,Fast and simple,Easy to use
1160,5,great!,can be formatted to pc or consoles
1161,3,Meh,Works fine but loses connection occasionally
1162,5,Easy Install for my MacBook Pro,"Fast install, I am able to use it between my MacBook Pro and iMac. I don't travel with it, I use it as an extra external hard drive for documents, videos, and photos."
1163,1,Does not work,"worked for a few days then it stopped working. Now it would not even get detected. Cannot mount, unmount, erase on Mac as well as windows."
1164,5,Works well for the PS4,Expanded my storage space immensely. I moved all my games to this external drive. They run well with no excessive loading times. I would almost say it seems slightly quicker than the stock internal drive loading speeds.
1165,5,Excelente,"Funciona perfectamente, 100% recomendado"
1166,5,Extra storage for my computers,"Unpack, plug in and use. It is that easy"
1167,3,Slower than any other drive I've ever used.,"Seriously slow. Like, maybe factory defect slow. I don't know, but it's got me looking into other options, which kinda sucks after spending so much buying two of these."
1168,4,Pretty good,It definitely gets the job done
1169,1,Worthless trash,"bought this in April of 22 and i'm already having issues. This external hard drive prevents boot ups and crashes my pc nonstop. Avoid this product, which im sad to say this because normally seagate takes some pride in their work but not for this pos garbage"
1170,3,"Is difficult to transfer albums, did with pictures and I couldn’t to nothing else",2 TB
1171,4,Easy to use.Came as promised.,It’s easy to use.Plug and play.Tons of storage and is fast.
1172,5,Hard drive,Bought the us as my first hard drive after my PS4 filled up. Easy to hook up.
1173,1,Doesn’t work after a few days,Stop working
1174,1,"Worked for 24 hours, then died","Ordered so my children could offload games from laptop memory.They downloaded them to the drive and the next day when they tried to access them, the drive couldn't be found by the computer.No amount of troubleshooting could access the drive and all the transferred files were lost.Very disappointing."
1175,5,Just what I needed,"I'm a graphic designer and needed a backup drive for a large project I'm working on.. not super techy, so I really appreciated how simple this thing was to plug in and set up with my backup program. Super reliable so far and the drive is much smaller than I expected for 4TB. Solid buy!"
1176,2,Slow as molasses in January,25MB/s write speed is the best I'm getting. Lots of storage for a decent price otherwise.
1177,1,Ps4 doesn’t support the storage device.,I just got it today and I thought it was ps4 supported but after i plugged it in it said that ps4 doesn’t support it
1178,5,Plug and play,Simple enough for me to get working
1179,5,perfect experience,Amazing service.Received the item in one day.Works like a dream.
1180,1,Bad Drive/ Poor Support,"I recently purchased this product to store my client's files as a back up to my computer's.I went on a trip out of the country and took some pictures.I stored them on this drive and hoped later to transfer them to my main computer.Once I connected and opened the drive, I literally watched my files disappear one after the other until there was nothing on it.I contacted Seagate but they were not helpful at all.They offered me the use of a useless software for 30 days to recover my files.That, unfortunately was a waste of time.I ended spending $1200 at a local ""data recovery place"" and got 90% of my files back.I contacted Seagate for a replacement since this happened only 5 months after purchase and was told my warranty was voided because a third party opened the drive.I thought as a courtesy they would have repalced it for me for a second chance to use their products, I was wrong.They did not care.Ps. I am not saying their products are not good - I had a good one before that I have been using for years and that was why I decided to buy this new one with more space.I only wanted to share my experience because of the way they handled the situation.The only way for me to recover my valuable family and client pictures was to use a third party as Seagate would not do much to help me, but this voided the warranty????My only options were to either proceed as I did to recover my files or get a product replacement then lose my files.My files were priceless and that is why I ended up spending over a thousand dollars to get them back."
1181,1,Trash,Thai product is absolute trash! I had this device for less then a year and ever since I got it it’s caused nothing but problems! First when I plugged it into my Xbox it wouldn’t recognize for 15 minutes and then when I finally got it to work I started saving games on it. The second I tried to transfer games back onto my Xbox to play it would freeze the Xbox and not work. I tired to call to get the device replaced through warranty and they gave me the run around and now finally after only 6 months the hard drive doesn’t work at all. It beeps and won’t even show up on the Xbox! When this happened I read reviews and all I see is people having the same issues! Seagate is aterrible company and they have terrible products. I would never recommend them to anyone who wants products that actually work.
1182,5,Love this thing,Its awesome. easy to use and set up
1183,5,Does The Job!,It was smaller then what I thought it was going to be which is even better! Works perfect and super easy to use! Already started using it and it holds everything that I needed it too. Would buy again from this company
1184,5,Love it!!!,"Small, portable and fast! Love it!!!!"
1185,5,Nice storage,Can finally store my Hent- errrr Games in pc now
1186,2,Ps5,"Tried it for my ps5 but it wasn't working, idk if it's just me having this problem but says it should work for PlayStation. Unless I need a specific one for ps5"
1187,2,This device was not recognized by Windows 7.,"I may not buy another Seagate drive because of its limited ability to be used by older systems. It would not be recognized by my Windows 7 systems and the directory structure has had to be ""fixed"" both times I used it with Windows 10. I'm pretty disappointed. It's nice and small but that positive is more than cancelled by its poor behavior."
1188,5,Nice hard drive.No issues.,Plugged it right in and it started working.I bought this as a backup to my other Seagate 8TB HDD and set up a sync job to run nightly to this one.No complaints.
1189,5,Liviano y compacto.,Liviano y compacto.
1190,4,Satisfied so far,"Price was very fair, packaging generic (not retail) but good, and trouble-free so far. I used it for a 450GB Time Machine backup on a 2012 MacBook Pro, and Time Machine estimated it would take15 hours. It didn't actually take that long (more like 8 hours), but on my MacBook, the backup speeds nonetheless seemed fairly poor. For perspective, I can *download* 450GB over my 1 megabit fiber optic internet connection in around an hour. It's very possible the backup speed is limited by something in MacOS or something in the MacBook hardware, so I can't blame this drive with any certainty.Plus I care more about reliability, which is an unknown to me until I've used it for around a year."
1191,5,completely worth it,"I had gotten a 1tb version of this few months back for my Xbox one s and just got a series s and got this an it’s what I needed , woulda got the 4tb if I had the extra money😂"
1192,5,Great choice,"Has a lot of space' it's small and fits next to my furniture console-works good, and does the job. Would order again"
1193,5,Stuff,250 GIGs over a USB 2 from my old computer in 2.5 hours.
1194,5,Good,Worked as expected
1195,5,Little power house,Running out of room on xbox this holds all of our games and allows the xbox to run much smoother and faster
1196,4,Good external hard drive,I like the product
1197,3,Was not preformatted,It came formatted for a windows computer despite saying designed for both windows and Mac operating systems. Not a big problem as I just reformatted the device but still an inconvenience.
1198,5,Works great!,Bought this for my husband for his PlayStation. He loves this thing he is able to store a bunch of games on it.
1199,2,Terribly Slow,"Running a backup to this drive, its about 1/10 the speed of a similar Toshiba."
1200,1,false advertising---this does not work on macs,"I plugged it in. Open the Seagate Portable Drive on my mac desktop, clicked on the Start_Here_Win.exe....and obviously it doesn't work. There is no mac compatible file."
1201,4,so far so good,"had some annoying software already installed that I had to delete (no, I don't want to use your cloud, that's literally why I'm buying hardware for storage) but otherwise so far so good. the write speed isn't super fast but I'm not bothered"
1202,5,It’s the go to.,Perfect.
1203,5,Recommended item!,Works great for storing contents of old computer. Easy transfer to the new computer!
1204,2,Worst Drive I've Bought In 20 Years,"This review is for the 4TB model No. ASM1053E.I bought 2 of them(one each for me and 'her indoors'.)Received them Feb 14th 2021.......my missus' one packed up in May 2022 and mine packed up today,July 27th 2022. Thats just over a year. FOR BOTH!I solved the problems of accessing the drives,(unlike most people i build computers etc)by prising them open and removing the drive. Stick them in a USB caddy,'repair drive' a couple of times,mount/unmount and they will work. But i did notice one of them still semi-freezes,so i'm still not convinced its entirely the enclosures USB3 interface.One thing is for sure: I wont ever be buying one again.by the way-i have 40 hard drives. I'm still using Western Dig's from early 2000s that i pulled out of Lacies,old Laptops,you name it. These were the worst/most dissappointing, i've ever had."
1205,4,GReat Buy,Works for me
1206,5,Great,Great
1207,1,"All of a suden, just stopped working on!!!","Worked well for months, until it started making a wierd buzzing noise. Now I can't access my files no matter what I try. I promise you I kept it in good care. I didn't drop it or got any substance on it. It just stopped working."
1208,2,Xbox Series S/X Users.,"This does not work with the Xbox Series X as a media storage for recording videos. If that's what you are. looking for, this is it --> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W55K9N6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details"
1209,5,Been great so far,"I've been a long time and happy user of Seagate external HDs for my Mac. None have let me down, and this one so far is working great."
1210,5,Great for DISH NETWORK external hard drive,For 6 years I used a Seagate 1TB hard drive for storing sports from DISH NETWORK.It was getting close to filled so tried this SEAGATE model. Super easy with Hopper and easily formatted and within 10min I was backing up more stuff from the DISH DVR.
1211,5,"If you value your data, then you need at least 1 of this little marvels",(I have four). Don't want to lose My DATA!!!It is Plug and Play!
1212,1,It stoped working for no reason,The media could not be loaded. Dislike I used it for my ps4
1213,5,Drive,Very good product..
1214,5,Was able to transfer media quickly,So far so good. Most of my Seagate hard drives have worked great. This one is right there.
1215,5,Gate way to storage,"It simple, it works, it got storage. It's norma size of any backup device, not as thick."
1216,5,5000 Gigs of data!,"I got this as my backup drive for my Blu ray disc. I've 5 years of my pictures and videos (mostly 4K) on my iPhone and I constantly take a backup on my Blu ray discs. I want a redundant copy of all these data. This drive helped to create a backup easily. The only negative is, the drive is a bit slow once the capacity went over 4 TB. That is ok with me."
1217,5,6T good price,"Truth be told I have two 5T drives that are variants of this drive from 2018 that I use for backups, purchased together. One serves as a primary external drive. The other is never connected except during removal from a fireproof safe. That same stored drive will now not run, despite switching positions into my normally used ""other"" drive of the exact same config to test cables and adaptors. I guess this is par for the course with backup drives?In any case, I was led back here to purchase another drive because, according to BackBlaze, these drives have high reliability. I considered spending 4x on a solid state drive, but BB stats alleviated concerns about better reliability of SSD vs HD. I am not going to mourn the loss of my prior drive, I have multiple backups spread across a variety of drives... still to have a drive fail and come back to purchase another seems the definition of insanity, but for the fact that I do not have hundreds of these drives tested over years in server systems (like the analysis from BackBlaze).My primary use for these types of high capacity drives is for archival storage of photographic data, and to act as a storage source for my home music server with Plex.This current Seagate drive sits on your desktop, with a power adaptor included and attached. It is not really portable.It took over 15 hours to move a couple of terabytes of data between my old Seagate and new Seagate, but that is not the fault of the drive; more an issue with the USB ports I have on my now 4 year old Dell (updated but not for the USB). Average transfer speeds of 25-30M/s are a bottleneck. Data integrity was good but for a couple of files where I had to dig into prior backups to correct (good to know).I hope insanity does not become a statistical issue with the new drive, which for the time being I am letting stay connected."
1218,3,Partial compatibility,Highly portable and easy for plug and play. Is only party comparable with PS5 in that it only stores PS4 games for backwards compatibility but not any PS5 games.
1219,5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!,the product was as described and operational
1220,5,Amazing Portable HDD,I needed more storage for my PS5 and this 1TB Seagate works amazingly.
1221,1,"It supposed to be compatible with MAC, and it wasn’t. It is only for windows",I couldn’t use it because it is not compatible with MAC
1222,5,Used Seagate for many years!,"Have not had any bad experiences with Seagate external or internal hard drives.This unit is fast and works great.Definitely Recommend for the Price, Quality, and Function."
1223,5,Hard drive,Didn’t know I had to format it for MAC computers. Looked it up on YouTube. Got it to store photos and videos. It’s good for that
1224,5,Great back up device,"Small size, well-known company with a good product"
1225,5,Good price,For my son’s gaming.
1226,5,i love it,the amount of storage is amazing
1227,5,GREAT BUY,Does exactly what it is made for. I use it for video editing.
1228,5,Good Quality.,Have owned for 2 years. Great quality and highly recommend.
1229,5,"It is very quiet, and black","As are most electronic storage devices, it quietly goes about it's business. Unobtrusive until it fails, which this unit hasn't, so far . . ."
1230,5,Great Seagate Product,"This is my second Portable 1TB External Hard Drive HDDThe first is over 7 years old and going strong, no issuesI use both to back-up both my MAC and PC"
1231,5,Reliable,Very reasonable price and. Works great
1232,5,Excellent,I love it
1233,1,Doesn't work with Apple computers,"Doesn't work with Apple computers, if you have Apple, don't buy this item, very simple."
1234,1,Not for mac,This device says it’s for windows and Mac. It lied.
1235,5,Perfect for Storing My Digital Game Library,"I have a lot of games and while I don't need to have them all downloaded and installed on my computer at once, I like to have all my options available. As of right now, I have a few hundred games on it with plenty of room to spare. My games include large ones such as the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Horizon Zero Dawn, some Monster Hunter games and many more. It has been the perfect option for having all my games available to play as my PC doesn't have nearly enough space for everything. I mainly play digital games through Steam, and haven't experienced any major problems with using an external hard drive though I have occasionally had to get it reconnected to remind it that the games are installed as every once in a while I will turn on Steam and it will show that no games are installed though the issue has always been resolved quickly and easily. Photos show external hard drive for general size idea, and a couple screenshots that show number of games and how much storage is currently being used for them all."
1236,2,This is NOT a solid state drive,"I have wanted and held off on purchasing a back-up drive for several months, because the solid state drives with the capacity I wanted were rather expensive. When seeing this model I immediately went to ""questions"" to see if it was in fact solid state. Several queries were answered ""YES"", it WAS solid state. This was the sole basis of my purchase. Upon plugging it in I heard the platter(s) spin up, meaning, obviously, it is NOT solid state."
1237,5,Awesome!,"Should have purchased one earlier, as it would have saved me a lot of aggravation.I have had two computers turn into door stops, and then had to recreate my files.This is so much easier, and why I didn’t do this before, I just don’t know.I have downloaded my entire storage files, and only used less than 1% of my drive.I am so impressed."
1238,5,"Nice, sleek, and easy to use.",Really good and simple to use. I just plugged it up to my Xbox Series X and it connects and recognized immediately. I’ve been using it for some time now and so far hasn’t gave me any issues.
1239,5,Great,Like this product
1240,3,This unot is twice as thick as my previous drives.,Good storage capacity but much thicker in size than expected
1241,5,Reliable,"I had to switch from WD to Seagate for reliability issues and so far, my seagate products are built to last without issues.Love it.It arrived as expected, with the described accessories and unmolested."
1242,5,Increíble almacenamiento con un buen precio.,Si estás buscando almacenamiento para Xbox series x o s este producto es muy buena opción.El producto es de 2tb recomendable si quieres jugar a muchos juegos.
1243,5,Works,Used it for my Dish receiver. Easy to work. Worked for me.
1244,1,Lies about compatibility,This product is NOT supported on PS4. Waste of money. BewareI contacted support who then told me that the device is perfect and it’s my PS that has issues. But customer service doesn’t know if it’s a defected device and he’s assuming my PS is having problems it’s never had before. More lies. I’ll never buy from them again. JUNK AND LIES.
1245,4,Very satisfied,Great portability with small footprint.More than enough capacity
1246,4,Only took 15 minutes to download all my pictures to it.,I like the speed and portability of it.
1247,5,Very lightweight & works great!,Everything worked great!
1248,1,100% Junk,copied 200gb of backup to this and after the files copied the drive shows nothing..space is taken but zero files on the drive. This thing is trash 100% Do not buy.
1249,5,Still using this today. Very reliable drive,Nice drive and computer always recognizes it. I travel a lot and have never had any issues so far.
1250,5,This is my second Seagate.,I've been using an identical one and they function perfectly.
1251,5,Darn good SSD Drive,"I quickly started to run out of space on my MacBook Air's 256GB SSD, with multi-GB games. The USB 3.0 Seagate SSD works great. For the best performance on my MacBook Air (Silicon), I had to reformat the drive to APFS, Seagate Tech Support was great for that, and I actually play my games from the Seagate Drive. I highly recommend this product."
1252,1,"no software support, download its dashboard/toolkit, both not work on latest win10","no software support, download its dashboard/toolkit, both not work on latest win10, s/w runs but no action/function buttons for backup or restore.Normally if you plug into a new laptop, it might become unrecognized, you get to use admin partition tool to reactive it."
1253,1,DOESN'T WORK WITH MAC,"I was given t believe that this worked with Mac Computers. Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, MacIT DOESN'T"
1254,1,Doesn't work on mac,"The product details and the box both say this works on mac right out of the box. However, it doesn't work on my MacBook."
1255,1,Don’t buy,Very dissatisfied
1256,1,doesn't work on Xbox one or PC,"2 different xbox's won't read the device.I can plug it into a pc and see it in the device manager, but not disk management or file explorer. Will be returning."
1257,1,product unusable unless buyer agrees to a very long list of terms and conditions,THE PURCHASERIS FORBIDDEN from using the drive UNLESS AGREEING FIRST to a very long list of terms and conditions and permission to seagate to send advertising to your email
1258,4,Great drive for single use long term storage,"This Disk is not designed for photo/video editing since is limited to USB 2.0 but for daily backups / file storage is great.portability is the most noticeable design.Not as sturdy as say LaCie, but it fits comfortably on any computer bag/backpack not bulky and very sturdy."
1259,5,Useful,Very useful
1260,1,Data loss,"Hard drive won’t read on anything but will light up, lost all my data."
1261,1,DOA 4 Months,"Drive worked fine until I decided to do the unthinkable act of... moving it physically. DOA after 4 months, really? Garbage."
1262,5,Harddrive,Good for storing videos and pictures
1263,5,That it does work.,So far so good. I was able to free up a lot of space on my laptop from just transferring a bunch of files and programs to the Seagate One Touch external hard drive. I had to do this for my video editor to work properly on my laptop.
1264,1,Trash doesn’t WORK,I’m pissed. Spent $50 on this stupid thing so I could clear off a laptop I don’t use. Won’t let me move anything on it. GARBAGE
1265,5,Compact Giant,Love that all that storage space comes in small Compact Case
1266,5,Ehh really loud,Its pretty decent
1267,3,3 star,so far so good
1268,5,Great price easy to setup,Easy to setup and a great price
1269,5,The external hard drive is an excellent purchase,Great for downloading Xbox games
1270,3,2 GB Seagate.,"It seems to be OK, I could not get it to do an automatic back up? I just haven’t had time to play with it yet as of yet."
1271,5,A lot of storage for a reasonable price.,I use this on my Xbox series x and it works great. It reads at a fast pace and downloads well. I remember a time when a 64mb memory card for the ps2 cost $40 so for 4 terabytes of storage for $80 is definitely a price I'm happy with.
1272,3,Mac,If they are going to sell this as Mac ready I shouldn't have had to jump through hoops to get it to work with I Mac.
1273,5,EzPz,"Worked well, plug and play for the most part"
1274,1,Garbage,"Garbage Drive. Bought as a gift for my father-in-law in late 2019 and he took his time before getting around to using it. It never worked for him and he gave it to me late 2021 to see if I could get it working. Just tried to get it working today. Does not show up as a drive on windows when plugged in. Does not show up on Disk Management. Does show up on Device Manager under disk drives and says it is operating properly. Tried uninstalling, different computers, different cables, YouTube, etc and still doesn't work. Windows makes a sound when plugged in, but nothing shows up. Signed up for an account on Seagate to file a warranty claim and warranty expired 2020... Product is still new and was never used once. Brand new garbage!"
1275,5,Great Buy,it’s so much cheaper than all the stores around here! Now my PS5 can play all the games I want without running out of storage!
1276,4,Have Patience,"This product is compatible with Mac/PC. Watch the videos to format the external drive as needed. It's fast and easy. I did not see the videos until I was about to return the product. But it does work well. Dear Amazon, I suggest placing the videos in the product's descriptions for easier access to understanding how to properly format, otherwise all other non-nerds will just keep returning the product. :D I hope this external disk last long but we shall see. Thank you!"
1277,4,So far I like this product.,"Overall I like it , but they shorted me some TB."
1278,5,Pleased,"I like how easy this was to use.I like how small it is with quite a bit of storage.It was an item recommend to me for keeping my treasured pictures, happy I bought it."
1279,5,Amazing...,Simply amazing. I love this thing! I should've bought one of these years ago..! Works perfect & haven't had any issues so far. Highly recommended!
1280,1,Absolute Junk - second one to die,"This is the second one to die on me. Each one backed up once, then died. I thought the first one was a fluke, but now I know these are junk. What's the point of backing up if the unit dies?"
1281,5,Craft storage,I use this to store all my SVG files as well as fonts and it works great.I use it with both my desk top and lap top.
1282,1,Piece of garbage,Storing any large number of files will take literally hours.Its just reads data too slowly.$50 more bucks will get you something ten times faster.
1283,5,Great Hard Drive,"Love it very much, worth the money."
1284,2,Two failed in less than 3 years... there is a pattern,"I've purchased 3 of these Seagate 5tb portable drives.Great price and worked great.. for less than 3 years.These drive are rarely connected to my PC.. they are back up drives.So it's not like they've been running 24/7 for almost 3 years.Backup drives, which are only powered up for short sessions are OMG not reliable and should be avoided."
1285,5,"Compact, Fast External Hard Drive","Great product for a great price. Small enough to be able to carry it in a small purse, bag, or even a large pocket. Easy to use and transfers data quickly."
1286,1,Laughable read/write speeds for a USB3.0 drive,Very deceptive product. USB3.0 but read/write is so slow they could have used USB2.0.Not clear about read/write speeds anywhere in the description.
1287,5,Great space for size.,"Easy tool use, drive space is great for its size."
1288,1,Says that its for MAC but is not only pc,the title says that it is for a mac but it will not reformat only works with PC
1289,4,Excelente,Muy buen producto
1290,5,Nice one,Good
1291,4,NA,NA
1292,1,Failed after a few months,"Failed completely after a few months.Used as backup in home environment.Complete data loss, with contents unrecoverable by standard disk recovery programs."
1293,1,Stopped working after 3 uses,"I've had the 5 tb one for over a year now and I used it bout 3 times since then never worked again. I've spent hours on youtube, google and Seagate tech support on why mine isnt working and nothing works. The light is on but refuses to show up on my pc I've gone my pcs bios, device mangament all sorts of crap and yes I am teck savvy as they say but nothing works so I bassically have a useless little box that refuses to work even if I try it on other computers so dont recommended 5tb one if anything buy 2 tb I never have problems with them. Found out that the higher the tb the worse they get."
1294,5,Excellent Storage,Excellent
1295,5,Good product,Used for PC backup. Been working great.
1296,1,took perfect care and have bad sectors 16 months after purchase.Do not buy.,"I have bought external drives before, I always take great care of my computer components and all other external drives lasted at least 3 years before I had any issues with them.This one lasted 16 months before I couldn't copy data off the drive.Ran a surface scan and it has multiple bad sectors.I will not be buying this or any other seagate drive again"
1297,1,Went corrupt in one year,This hard drive went bad within ~1 year. Was uploading data on it using my Mac and all data on the external hard drive was lost as the drive went bad. Could not reformat or recover the data. What a waste of money and valuable data. Will never buy this brand again.
1298,5,Great drive,Works right out of the box… no issues with windows 11 PC
1299,3,Not All Games Compatible,Is nice the storage capacity but the most newest games are not playable because the speed of the drive. Like Forza Horizon or Fortnite. But almost all games work well.
1300,2,Didn't stay working long,Worked for less than a year. Wouldn't waste my money on this style.
1301,5,Perfect for PS4,Works great and fast writing speed.
1302,5,Works great,I would buy this again.
1303,5,Excellent value and easy to use,Purchased to copy everything I had stored in the cloud in the event something unexpected happens. Connects and works like I expected without any technical support necessary - automatically appeared in my system
1304,5,great,glad I got this great storage and very compact
1305,4,DOES WORK FOR MAC / iOS,"I saw a lot of reviews on here that stated the hard drive doesn't work for Mac. It didn't at first. I had to go to Seagate's website. There's a page called ""How to Format Your Drive"" and it has instructions on how to make it work for your system. It was super easy and there were no additional downloads needed."
1306,4,It works,Easy to say up and use.
1307,1,Faulty Right Out of the Box!!,"I purchased this external hard drive as I had never had any issues with Seagates drives.This one spun up right out of the box with no issues.It took me 2 days to get all of the data moved over to it that I needed stored, and on day two (shortly after finishing the move) the drive stopped taking any new data and had changed itself over to a read only database.I figured there must have been something wrong with the formatting, and after taking 2 more days to move everything back off, I formatted the drive and 2 days later had everything moved back over to it.About 2 hours after moving everything back over again, it too failed and went into a read only format, so again I removed everything off of it and sent it back!!!"
1308,1,Computer Won’t Read,"When I tried to use this on my computer, I plugged it into several different USB ports in my desktop, and the computer wasn’t able to recognize the device. I couldn’t ever locate the drive anywhere on my computer, so after about 3 hours of trying, I finally gave up and opted for a return."
1309,5,For linux,I use the Fedora operating system. Plugged the drive in and it was ready to copy
1310,5,Got my backup done,About 2 times a year I do a full backup to a fresh drive.Used this to copy over all my data files and then an image of the operating system drive.Worked well with no issues.
1311,5,Excellent performance,"I'm using this device to store tv shows I like that are off-air. It accepts downloads with lightning speed, and playback is excellent. I can't complement this device enough to do it justice. And, the small size makes it a perfect carry-anywhere item."
1312,5,slim,very nice connection is almost instant
1313,5,Really good for ps5,I have every game I own for the PS4 on it. Works great on the ps5. Slight lag on COD: BOCW though
1314,5,Very good,Very good
1315,5,1 year and about a half still going good,"I've been using this for 1 year and about a half (Jan 2021-July 2022). I'm not even halfway. I've been using this to back up mostly my digital illustrations, Minecraft skins I made, Bible Project videos & images that I love, screenshots of typed prays from others, hw & projects from art/animation school, pictures of animals I find in my area being adorable or confused... & adorable, people being memes on the internet, and alike. My brother also uses this too but mainly for gaming and music that he makes & remixes (knowing my brother probably also memes lol). So yeh it holds quite a bit of stuff. I think having more than 1 backup is always great too :^)"
1316,5,Very Helpful,"Needed this product when my phone broke. I had 10k + photos, I needed something with lots of storage to move my photos too!This saved the day!"
1317,2,Started beeping and completely crashed and broke after only a few months of owning it,"It worked amazingly well for storage for my gaming... until it didn't. It started beeping and crashed completely, all data ruined, the drive unusable after only 3 months of owning mine. I had bought one before that only lasted me 4 months. Quality is not the best. Do not buy this. Sure it's affordable but it'll stop working within a few months /:"
1318,1,GGGGGRRRRR!!!,"Ugh. It initially worked. When I was adding more photos (around 500 to a particular folder) it stopped working completely & was making a beeping noise. When I looked at my disk management I could see the drive where device is but it's not initialized. I contacted Seagate and the sent me software to get the device working. No such luck. I have to send the device back and hope that all of my photos- several thousand, can be recovered. I do NOT recommend this product."
1319,1,Piece of junk.. Don’t buy,Bought this I. November 2020. Now it’s July 2022. Not even two years and this drive just quit working. Was using with Xbox. Have not moved it or dropped or anything. Just stopped working. Checked the cord. It’s fine and works with other hard drives I have. So I guess now all the data on this drive is lost. Do not buy this brand!! Stay away!
1320,5,Did not receive the warranty email yet.,30 dollars for the warrant that never came in email.
1321,3,Poor speed quality,This device gets really slow as you add data to it.
1322,2,You are guaranteed to spend at least an hour on tech support,"Don't expect to just plug this in.Mine had some problem where it was read-only, and needed to be reconfigured for my Mac. A completely exasperating tech support system where every time they asked me for a screen shot the process disconnected me. I went through four agents!"
1323,5,It’s exactly what you expect,"It’s just a hard drive, it works pretty well."
1324,1,"Most expensive paperweight I have ever bought, be cautious","This product is trash, come to buy a plug and play EHD, get sold a piece of trash I have spent a year trying to figure out. I am furious with the results of this crap, and the lack of assistance from Amazon or Seagate for the trash I was sold. I rate portability high due to the one redeeming feature, its actually a good portable size. Don't waste your money here and go to an actual store. You'll actually get something that works and not out $75, while being blown off when the product is faulty. Fraudulent at worst, incompetent at best."
1325,4,It DOES work with mac..,"I purchased the 2TB drive, and so far I have mixed impressions on the it. The packaging really threw me off and just felt odd for Seagate.. almost as if it was fake.. but so far it seems legit. But for those saying “it’s not working for my Mac, or did not format right for Mac” they clearly didn’t do their research. The drive comes READY for windows because it’s the most used computer OS.. and regardless It’s ALWAYS recommended to format your new drive regardless of the OS. The drive should be formatted to MacOS Extended ( Journaled) and GUID partition because it works best with spinning disk hard drives. Nothing lasts forever, so make sure you back up your most important data, always. I’ll definitely update this review in the coming months."
1326,5,Excelente Opción para videojuegos,Lo compre para usarlo con mi consola de videojuegos Xbox series S y ha funcionado de maravilla. Nunca he tenido inconvenientes. La calidad del producto es muy buena y ya me ha durado 1 año en el que le he sacado todo el provecho. Lo recomiendo totalmente
1327,1,NOT FOR MAC!!,"Don't do what I did and rely on the product's heading that says this hard drive is for Mac!It is NOT!!I unfortunately chose this product on Prime Day when I should have selected a different external hard drive that actually DOES support Mac. Now I've wasted the Prime Day sale, and I'm inconvenienced. Not happy."
1328,5,Good product,Worked as advertised
1329,5,Affordable and Reliable,Working well after 4.5 months.No issues.Using on a PC.Works essentially the same way as a flash drive just with a lot more capacity.
1330,5,Wow! A 14 Terrabyte external hard drive for this price.REALLY?!!!!,"I love it.14 Terrabytes on a hard drive for all my movies, music, books, pics, ..Incredible price. Incredible storage capacity.And Seagate.Unbelievable.Took a day to encrypt the drive, and another 2 days to copy over my data.So far, so good.Quick response and only one location to look for my data.I'll get another one just to make a backup and the other hard drives lying around?I guess its time to send them packing.Very satisfied client."
1331,1,Failed after a year's use.,"Windows refused to recognize device after 13mo's use. Windows 10 Pro V.21h1.Device just ""spins"" and never completes it's startup check."
1332,1,Slow Drive and then stopped working out of nowhere,I was hoping to increase my storage with this but not only does it run slower than my other drive (WD 4TB My Book) but out of nowhere it stopped working. I'm returning this to get another WD Drive. Would not recommend this Seagate one.
1333,5,Get what I needed,"Have no issues, works perfectly. Use it for my PS4 and haven't had any problems."
1334,2,This is for Windows,This hard drive is not compatible with Mac. So now I have two $65 paperweights and no way to transfer my files. THANKS SEAGATE!
1335,5,I recommend,"Good speed, excellent HDD."
1336,2,Does NOT work on XBOX Series S,"The description said it would work for XBOX Series S but when games are stored on it, it says that the storage is too slow for the game. So, games can be stored on this but must be moved back to XBOX hard drive to play"
1337,4,pretty good storage for our family pics and videos,hope it lasts!
1338,3,Slow slow slow!,It’s a good storage device but the load time on games is EXTREMELY SLOW!
1339,5,Product was good while it lasted. Stopped working after 9 months,X box
1340,5,8T or smaller for Consoles Only!,"Well. I was pretty excited to get this for my PS5. Didn't realize buying a 10T Hardrive would basically be useless. Pretty pissed off Im out $230 but it's not the seller's fault. This is strictly on Sony's head. Apparently the PS5 doesn't allow for any external devices bigger than 8T's. If I had known this before hand, I'd have bought a smaller drive...More angry because I wiped my two 4T's for no reason because I had planned to give them to my brother to have... Oh well. I'll see if I can use it on my Xbox One and if not? I still have my laptop even though I have no idea what I'd need such a large box for 🤣Either way. Seems like a pretty good product and fairly durable."
1341,5,Amazing Storage!Tough and durable.,"Amazing Storage!I've had this for a while and traveled with it cross country twice and it's still runs great. Great deal for the price.Thank you for making an amazing product, so that I can work on my video projects.I only had to replace the cable once, and got another one at best buy for $15.So very affordable.New update: after over a year and few too many drops,, I bought another one. This one I got the 2 year recovery. If this is your first time buying I recommend the 2 year or more warranty. Still glad to have the 4TB of space!"
1342,5,Soo awesome,I bought this for my Xbox x and I have not been dissapointed. The cost is where will start its cheaper than all the gaming external harddrives and works the same. I have it mounted under my x series mount and I have had no issues.Pros:* cost effective it was half the price of the ones for the console* size it's very portable so I can transfer it in between my consolesCon:*None I love this harddrive
1343,1,Never worked!!!,Never worked!!! It shipped to me and I plugged it into my computer and it was corrupted. I went into disk utility to wipe it and restart and then it never showed as being connected to either of my computers again. Thanks
1344,5,Seagate 5G,Been using this brand for years and I've never had any problems with them at all. As a matter of fact I have some that are over 10 years old and still working
1345,5,Exactly what I needed.,"It is what it is, portable storage. It works easily, is intuitive and money for the TB I found it to be reasonable."
1346,5,Is awesome how many games it can hold,I like it great buy
1347,3,"Purchased Aug 1, 2020 for PS44. Stopped working 2022 with PS5",Bought the 5TB back in 2020 for my PS4. Started using it this year on my PS5 and it didn't last long. Only lasted 2 years so be aware.
1348,5,Love it!!,I can play all my games now with out having to re-download. Should have bought this item a long time ago
1349,2,Waste,Has never worked properly
1350,1,Not Mac compatible,"Opens and goes straight to win.exe. It will NOT work with a mac, even though it is advertised to do so. Sorry, but had to return."
1351,5,Great external hard drive for xbox,This was super easy to set up and took less than 5 minutes to connect it and format it to our xbox.My kids are super excited to have so much more storage for their games.
1352,1,drive failed on day25,"It failed on day 31. My tablo said it failed a few days earlier, but it to me that long to figure out it was disk problem."
1353,5,Worked well,Good for backup storage of files
1354,5,Does its job,So far I haven't had any problems. I was able to back up my information.
1355,5,Great for its price tag,The item is exactly as described by the seller.
1356,1,Heads got stuck,one day the heads got stuck and I couldn't do anything about it it sucks now it cant be fixed
1357,5,Great back up device,"This is very fast,and small"
1358,5,Tons of storage. It's great,"I'm normally a Western Digital guy, but got this as it was on sale and can't complain at all. This is great for storage."
1359,5,Ease of Use,Easy to use. Faster transfer than anticipated.
1360,5,V,This product was no problem it showed up on time and works perfectly very easy to use very compact and a great price
1361,1,"Became unusable as it won’t erase, mount/unmount properly.",Doesn’t work
1362,5,Storage and then some,Love the extra space! Wish my gf take notes 😉
1363,4,I really like this Hard Drive.,"I have had this drive for almost 2 years and have had no problems, its been dropped a few time but still works just fine, I thought by now I would have broken it from it falling, but nope. I am actually impressed with the build of it, I use this for games and I love having this much space, at the time I bought mine the price was a bit cheaper."
1364,5,"Just as described, great price and great product.",Price was great and the quality was better. I run many games well on it and I have a Lenovo Legion 5 gaming laptop.
1365,2,What has happened tothe Seagates??????,"Over the past ten plus years, I have bought and used three other Seagates and have loved working with them for the ease and reliability.Have not had one issue with any of these first three.Based on that, bought this latest one (2TB).What a difference!First, let me say, this purchase was a mistake and likely to be my last Seagate.This one even fills cheap right out of the package.Took way too long and spent too much time just to register it.Too much needless stuff at the beginning to just register the item.The first thing I tried to write, took a day and a half.None of the first three were anywhere remotely this slow.Certainly, if I had been aware of its slowness, would never have bought.Are all the other new Seagates this slow; I have ants in the garage that move faster.Am so disappointed in the Seagate manufacturer now.Once a great product, now a piece of junk."
1366,1,Do NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC,Brought this product because it said I could use it with my Mac. I absolutely can not use this or I will lose my data.
1367,1,NOT for a MAC,"Soooo disappointing, its advertised as being Mac compatible - it is not."
1368,1,Unreliable Product,"I bought this product back in January 2022. Within a month it broke. Seagate tech-support was essentially useless. Amazon customer service was fantastic. They sent me a replacement in February. It is now July 10, 2022 and the hard drive has broken again. I have been warned about Seagate being unreliable but this product is pretty pathetic in this day and age. It looks like my return window expired at the end of March so I’m not sure what I’m gonna do or what I will replace it with but maybe Amazon is willing to help me out (again). I know that Seagate will not be helpful."
1369,5,Has lots of space,Nice size
1370,5,It’s not 2t it’s 1.5t,When my bf installed this to his Xbox he noticed he only had 1.5t nothing has been downloaded don’t waste your money
1371,5,TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!!!,I have edited a few Final Cut Pro projects on it no hick ups and it’s fast! no problems here. I’ve stored footage and photos and it’s perfect! It hasn’t let me down once!! Totally recommend and I will definitely buy another one soon!!
1372,1,Don’t waste your money,"Plain and simple it says it works for PlayStation, it doesn’t. It’s really frustrating that they would screw up something this simple. There are other storage devices do not get this one."
1373,5,Great Drive So Far!,"No problems with this drive at all. Exactly as expected. As a professional photographer, I deal with thousands of very large files, and am always in need of lots of storage for onsite backup.I've never had any problems with Seagate drives in the past, and I don't have any reason to believe this one will be any different."
1374,4,Arrived late,It arrived 2 days late. Thankfully it was not damaged
1375,5,Excelente!!,Muy buena relación precio/calidad. Gran almacenamiento. Funciona muy bien
1376,5,Seagate USB it works.,"Well it works, as a USB drive should, not much more to say. Just a Seagate drive not much to say it just do what it is supposed to."
1377,1,Worst hard drive ever!!!!,I only had this hard drive for two months didn’t buy warranty cause they say there hard drives last 3 years max and it gave out on my causing me to lose half of my games saves data and half of my PC files that are important to me
1378,1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MAC,"Says in the description that it works with Mac, but as soon as you plug it in it says it’s not supported unless you have Microsoft Windows."
1379,5,"Small, large capacity","The storage drive that I had previously used to back up my 1TB Mac computer failed, so I needed a replacement. This filled the bill perfectly. It's small, and all you have to do is plug it in and select Backup under Time Machine."
1380,5,This is awesome!,"I have used Toshiba external hard drives for 20 years. All of the ones that I have purchased in the last 2 years are absolute crap! Cheap!No plug and play!Defective!So I decided to try this brand it got great reviews. It is awesome!Totally easy set up, transfers and save data quickly, it it is portable, easy to use! Plenty of memory space!I highly recommend it"
1381,5,Just what I needed,Just what I needed
1382,1,Painfully slow drive. Do not buy if you need a work drive.,"The write speeds are painfully slow. Snails pace. Not usable if you are working with audio or video. This is strictly a backup drive for backup storage, and it’s a shame it’s advertised as high speeds."
1383,4,Love Seagate Harddrives,As usual these are exceptionally well made hard drives… my oldest Granddaughter uses this for gaming and the value for 5 TB of space is exceptional!! Great gaming hard drive which has extended the life of our PS4 …. While we continue to wait patiently for Amazon to email me and tell me I can pickup my PS5!!!! Also use one on the XBOX-X…. I managed to get one of these when they were first released…. COME ON SONY!!!! 😬
1384,1,Scrambles my data,"I've never had so many issues with an external drive before, or at least not these issues that I'm having. I have files that have disappeared and when I replace that file in the same directory location, it gives me an error saying that there is already a file with the same name there. I have files that I can't delete. I have files that I can't move. Super disappointed in this POS."
1385,5,Love Seagate hard drives.,Really like the 5TB storage capacity.
1386,1,This product did not work on a Mac as it showed.,I purchased this for a Mac but it would not work on a Mac I couldn’t return because I missed the window of return by a day ugh waste of money.
1387,5,Works are described,I have it full of apps that I use but not super frequently. Works great. One issue is that it seems fragile without a case
1388,1,Unbelievable slow makes it not useable,"I tried two of these units. I am a longtime user of Seagate drives for archiving my video projects. It has long been the most inexpensive option that seems somewhat reliable...I have 16 of the 8tb drives and they all work fine, no issues. I got two of this 10 tb drives and experienced the exact same issue. I got about 1tb of footage on the drives and then they both just transfer at the slowest speeds. They also got so hot maybe the internal parts melted. I don't know. All I know is these drives don't work and I would recommend staying away as data is too important to mess with these."
1389,5,Works as expected,I bought it to use as extra storage for my Xbox Series S and it works like a charm
1390,5,Perfecto!!!!,"Llego en perfectas condiciones y a tiempo, mil gracias por todo.Saludos y quedo muy feliz!!!!"
1391,5,Buena calidad.,Perfecto.
1392,1,"2 yr old Drive Failed, has only one year warranty","At first I liked the quiet and slim drive. Using it as a Time Machine backup for my Mac, it failed in year two. The $150 8-GB drive was only half full. The Seagate warranty is only one year. In my 30 year computer career I have only had Seagate drives fail. This will be my last."
1393,1,The world is literally in shambles and all I can think about is how much I hate this drive.,"I've used WD drives for years with zero issues but figured I'd give Seagate a go for once, as this was a decent price for 8tb. Straight away I backed up a handful of other smaller drives to it, mostly photo and video, which took an insanely long time to transfer, like abnormally long, like a day and a half of straight transfer for maybe 4tbs... whatever. After the drives were backed up I placed it in my desk drawer for about a year where it sat, completely unmolested, safe from the elements, etc. until I pulled it out today to grab some old files. Lo and behold, this practically brand new drive which I had only mounted once now wont even draw power, the light doesn't come on, nothing. Yes, I tried multiple cables, computers, outlets, everything. The power supply works on my other drives but this one remained as dead as can be. After a couple hours of toil, I gave up. Meanwhile, the WD Mybook I've had since 2014 is still going strong, even after being dropped once or twice. I'm going to see what tech support has to offer but it's unacceptable that a drive should ever fail this quickly. I think this might be my first ever Amazon review, which is a testament to how very angry I am. Anyways, save yourself some trouble and avoid Seagate like the plague, unless you enjoy paying $200 for a paperweight."
1394,5,Worksp,Works for xbox series S
1395,4,A terabyte of data in a jacket pocket...,"I've only had it for a short time but so far so good.Bought it so I could clone my laptop's hard drive.It did that, no problem.It comes with some Seagate software but that's easy to ignore.I'll take care of my own encryption.Physically, the case isn't exactly titanium.But it's not like I'm carrying it off to war.So far, it's done what I bought it for."
1396,4,Great product!Confusing to install.,Took me a while with their tech support to get it to work.Works well now.
1397,5,Works perfect,Easy to use product. Works very well.
1398,1,Tragically slow. Maybe just a defective drive..,"When I purchased the “Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox - 1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)“ I needed an external drive ASAP and this drive offered next day am delivery. Iusually buy WD or Corsair drives but I could get this by the following mourning so I bought it. When I first used it, the drive it was very slow backing up a computer. It was a troubled computer so I figured it was just a slow machine. When I transferred the data to my file server it was slow uploading; but since the source PC was in bad shape I just figured the data was problematic. I've used it twice since then and unfortunately the Seagate drive is just tragically slow. After looking at the Amazon reviews again I'm guessing it's just a defective drive so it's going back."
1399,1,"Drives failed spectacularly, not once, but twice","I bought two of these to backup files on my desktop.I backed up the same files to each drive, and they were perfectly accessible and functional from the drives after being copied.A couple days later, I cleared the files from my desktop with the intention of restoring them later shortly thereafter. Only then did I discover about 80% of the files on the first backup drive were corrupted. The second backup drive proved to have the same issue. But because the corruption wasn't consistent among the files on each drive, I was able to recover about a third of them overall. A data recovery utility was able to salvage another 50% of them after lengthy repairs.My prior experience with Seagate drives was largely positive, but they'll never be my first choice moving forward. They had one job, and they failed spectacularly at it, not once, but twice."
1400,5,Did not work I had to send it back,This portable hard drive came in operable
1401,5,Pretty straight forward.,"Great size in my laptop carrying case. Isn’t too bulky. Fits fine along with other accessories in same pocket. 2TB, haven’t worried about game GB yet."
1402,3,Not intended for MAC’s,Does NOT work on MAC computers as stated in their product description
1403,5,Excelente,Excelente
1404,1,NOT FORMATTED FOR MAC,"Even though it claims that it works for MAC, it's not. This is only formatted for Windows and PC.Seller: Please update your heading to reflect that STGX2000400 is NOT formatted for MAC."
1405,1,Crashed in 18 months,"Buyer beware.I actually purchased 2 of these Seagate drives. They were the first items I ever purchased from Seagate having been a San Disk and Kingston owner in the past.If you have a good relationship with a product, don't change just to save a couple of dollars.One of the drives started to make noise and then stopped functioning completely after only 18 months of intermittent use. Beyond the data recovery ""guarantee"" time period so Bye Bye 3 TB of pictures, documents, and videos.Lost all faith in the remaining drive and only use it now to store non-critical items. Never lost so much as a single file with my other non-Seagate back-up drives.Lesson learned."
1406,1,Terrible sustainability,It fell ONCE and never worked again I tried to get it repaired in several places but no one would take it.
1407,1,Not compatible with MAC though it says it is in the header.,"Not compatible with MAC's. Says in the header it is compatible but as soon as you buy it and register it, it gives you the option to click on ""MAC"" users. Once you click on it, it takes you to a page that just says ""this is only for windows."" Very misleading but hey, they definitely got me."
1408,5,Best investment,Best investment I made and great addition for surety video recording!
1409,5,Compact and Easy Connect External Storage!!,Used as secondary storage for An Alienware desktop computer system.
1410,5,Perfectly working external storage for PS4,"Wanted to get a decently priced, compact, and spacious external HDD for storing game files from the PS4. Does the job for a reasonable price."
1411,3,Not the quality I was expecting,Feels super cheap and uses a weird cord. Might work ok
1412,5,great little storage box,"great little storage box. fast light, quite"
1413,1,Does not work w/ Mac,"I've used Seagate w/ my macbook pro before, but for some reason you can't simply uplaod files to this one. you must create an account and it wont let me do so because it says can't open on Mac. Will be returning."
1414,5,Great size,As advertised - love it
1415,5,Good,My girlfriend loves it
1416,5,Works as described,I’ve used sea gate hard drives in the past and this one works and works well . 2tb of storage and worked right out of the box . It’s a little slow but does it’s job well .
1417,5,Used for Backup,I used this item for Backup of PC. Works Well. Easy to configure.
1418,5,A must-have item for backing up and saving!,I ordered this as a sort of last-minute emergency as my family's desktop p.c. was starting to have issues.It arrived quickly and was very easy to use: a simple plug-and-play type.No software downloads or installs were necessary!We got everything of importance backed up to the external hard-drive just in time!
1419,3,Good enough I guess.,"Bought the 20TB because I ran out of space on my 8TB hard drives. For starters, it's actually 18TB due to some nonsense that shouldn't be my problem, I should just have the 20TB of space I paid $500 for. Second, it sounds like an old desktop PC, noisy and slow to boot up, and there's a piece of metal inside thats bent and crushed that I hope isn't important. Lastly, 3 times now in one sitting I was transferring files and the file explorer or transfer screen crashed completely and almost corrupted my data transfers. The problem is, now that all my data is on this new junk I can't return it to get a less broken one. I'm stuck with this glitchy crap until I have a spare $500 again in the future. Unfortunate. But I guess it does it's most basic function, it holds your files. It might hold them hostage someday though."
1420,5,Realmente tiene mucha capacidad de almacenamiento,"El producto me llegó muy bien empaquetado, es muy fácil de usar, sólo hay que conectarlo a la. computadora de la misma manera en que se conecta cualquier otro dispositivo y listo, ya puedes comenzar a guardar todos los archivos que te ocupan espacio en la computadora, es una muy buena inversión, lo recomiendo 100%"
1421,5,Works with PS5,I specifically bought this so my boyfriend wouldn’t have to keep deleting and re-downloading games on his ps5. He said he has had no issues with lag.
1422,1,No instructions and makes your computer freeze up.,"No instructions at all. You plug it in, and nothing works since it makes your computer freeze up. Installed on a Windows 10 desktop, and restarting has not solved anything."
1423,1,Failed after 4 or 5 hours.....Just unlucky??? Once bitten............,Computer storage
1424,4,Lots of storage but constant disconnecting!,The drive I bought has 1 T of storage but it constantly disconnects. At first I thought it was just me shifting it and the cord accidentally unplugging but now it does it without my touching it at all. Good product just annoying.
1425,5,It's easy to ise on Mac or windows,I recently bought Mac air and I store lots of photographs in raw format .I use light room to edit my photography work. This product is easy to carry while I travel and it's fast when I connected to my laptop. I was a windows user but this is easy to configure in Mac as well.
1426,3,Put stuff on it but it is slow,I do scheduled backups to an external Seagate drive. I wanted more capacity. I bought this. The backup that took 30 minutes to the old Seagate drive takes 60 minutes on the new one. All things being equal so I'm disappointed in this drive.
1427,5,As described,Item is as described
1428,5,Works good,"It works and does what its supposed to do, just what I needed, was easy to use"
1429,2,Lasted Less than 3 Years,"I've been using external hard drives for decades, and maybe it's been good luck, but I've never had one fail in less than e years. This one lasted about 2 1/2 years before it started to fail."
1430,5,I can finally play sims,The media could not be loaded. I love it I got 1tb but it’s stil enough for me
1431,5,Easy to install!!,I am very pleased with this product. Have my son much more storage capacity on his gaming device. Super easy to install and very easy to store without being in the way.
1432,5,Great product,Everything I needed!
1433,1,It's pretty loud,"Not sure what happened but after writing about 1Tb, the drive made some loud ticking sound and it's not loading in window explorer. When I tried a different computer it kind of works but after trying to error checking it after 4 days, I gave up. Even tried the Seagate's error tools but still nothing. Who knows, maybe I needed to format it to NTFS for window instead of the default EXFAT for apple and window"
1434,1,Terrible Speed,"So this HDD has the speed of 40 MB/s at best, mostly it's around 20-10 MB/s. Takes forever to move files, utterly useless. I couldn't even get my money back, hoping for a replacement but probably won't get that either."
1435,1,Doesn't Work At All!!!,Purchased this as an extra storage for all my documents and it doesnt work. Tried to plug and play but the computer doesn't even recognize it as a device. Too far past the return date so I basically wasted my money.
1436,5,Just what I needed,"Well, this is exactly what I needed to keep up with my storage needs.I made a mistake, it was a formatting issue with my sytem, this drive is NTFS format by default so I have deleted the part relating to formatting from my review.I apologize for the error."
1437,5,Worked right out of the box,"I was looking for a small sized 2 TB and found this.Very good price, came in very quickly, and a good brand name.Good size not inconvenient and is portable.Was very easy to use just plug and play worked right out of the box.Very pleased, I would buy from them again.Thank you Amazon!"
1438,1,Two years then nothing,"I bought this SEAGATE 8TB / USB 3.0 HDD (STGY8000400) June 30, 2020; it has worked fine until today, when it just won't stay on once it is plugged in to power.Light flickers, then nothing, even though I can feel the vibration of the spinning platters.Windows 10 doesn't recognize the device.There's not even an error.Now out of warranty so it goes in the bin now.I have used Seagate products for decades and this is the first time one has failed so soon.I'm just lucky I have a backup for my backup!Cannot recommend these small external HDDs from Seagate."
1439,1,It's a brick. Don't buy this.,I bought 2 of these devices from Best Buy and one was dead when I plugged it in and the other just died after barely being used. This thing is trash.
1440,5,Great for my needs.,I use this for my retro gaming collection. Works like a charm on raspberry pi and MisterFPGA.
1441,1,piece of junk.,i downloaded all my kids pics and videos. thought they would be safe. Now i cant even open the hard drive. like its locked up. lost most of the things on it. my advice. use usb's .of coarse warrenty was void.
1442,1,DOES NOT WORK ON PS5,"When I plugged this drive into my system, it said it only have 500mb of space when I bought a 10TB. Will be returning asap"
1443,5,Excelente,"Todo muy bien, llegó correctamente. Gracias"
1444,1,Broke after 35 days,Broke 35 days unable to return. Waste of money
1445,5,Works,Copied all our CDs to this drive and still had room.
1446,2,Died after 1 year,"I was using it for Mac time machine backup. I was plugging it 2-3 times a month. It died today, MacOS no longer detects it. Don't buy."
1447,5,I like it,I like this I can't wait to put memory on this or idk
1448,5,This product does not work,The media could not be loaded. This item does not work when I tried to move my games to the storage it would keep disconnecting and reconnecting and It would not move to the storage device waste of money!!
1449,1,doesnt work,"plugged it in on several different computers, with several different cords, and it doesnt even register or seem like its on at all ......Made the mistake of not trying it before the return period ended so i mightve just flushed 50$ down the drain lol I'm gonna talk tocustomer support and hopefully get my money back bc they rlly just sent me a waste of plastic."
1450,5,Very important,Good working
1451,5,Perfect for what I need it for,"Having this hard drive has been great. At such a good price too. I got this as extra storage for my Xbox Series X. While the proprietary ssd being sold for $219 bucks may be faster, this is plenty fast enough with more space. I got a second one that I can use for my videos. Thank you"
1452,3,Tech Support,"In the previous two purchases, the electric plug came with 220 volts in Korea, but in this purchase, it is only a plug with an outlet connection method that matches the voltage regulation in the United States, so it is not convenient."
1453,1,dont use for Xbox,constantly have to unplug and plug into my Xbox for it to recognize. 10/10 would not recommend
1454,1,Faulty,Worked a couple months and then stopped working for no reason. Expensive piece of crap. Which is sad considering We have 4 others in the 4TB that have worked for years... But not this one.
1455,5,So far it been perfect,"Working for me, not much more to add. Getting the job done. No issues."
1456,5,External PS4 hard drive,Perfect for my PS4 pro
1457,5,Easy to use,My dish technician told me about this to transfer my DVR recordings to a different DVR. It was super easy to use. And dish has a step by step picture tutorial too. Just plug it in to back DVR and it pops up in your tv .
1458,5,grandson loves for his game,the product is perfect for game storage and using for travel
1459,2,Drive started to break down after 1 year,"It worked great from my purchase in late 2020 up until mid 2021, when it started to periodically disconnect under load (sometimes not even under load, and it's been inconsistent.) I still use the drive sometimes to access files (rarely though so it doesn't die on me), because the other *Seagate* drive (2TB internal barracuda) i partially backed it up to FULLY died less than 6 months after my purchase."
1460,2,DOESNT LAST LONG,"I have had mine for about 3 months, and i had it for xbox one game storage, i was playing a game and it kicked me off, no matter how many times i restarted or unplugged and replugged in, or even changed the usb port, it still doesn’t work, and i had my xbox rebuilt, there’s nothing wrong with it. i know it might not say registered purchase but i did purchase it, and it’s not a great one for gaming, i recommend a different one for gaming"
1461,5,Excelente artículo,"Llegó en exccelente estado, muy buen empaque"
1462,5,Small but HUGE - space that is...,"If you're looking for a simple user friendly no nonsense external harddrive this is it, for the price point it's great. LOTS of storage even though technically it isn't 4tb it's more like 3.5"
1463,1,Don't Bother!,"Have LITERALLY only had the drive for 3 months. Took the tiniest of falls (I know hard drives are fragile but I'm talking super small!) and now it is not working and will cost $1500+ to fix/get my data back. What a waste and an effin expensive paper weight. I have had many hard drives in my life and none that are this fragile. Super frustrated, but glad I had my data backed up elsewhere since this was clearly not worth the money!"
1464,4,* Not for PS5 *,"It connected to our Playstation 5 just fine, but can only be used to play PS4 games on PS5. My intention with this purchase was to have more room for PS5 games so I will be returning.I didn’t get to test the storage since I couldn’t store anything on it, so my review is only a warning to make sure you don’t purchase it to store PS5 games."
1465,1,May have lost my Data,"I bought this because I was encouraged by the reviews this would be a great way to not only back up but work with my data. I am literally a year from the date of purchase and I am having a local tech guru work to try and recover my data. It turns out external drives like this are very temperamental and not the most secure to store data. This has been a hard lesson to learn, but definitely changing how I will store my data. I would not purchase this again or encourage anyone to."
1466,1,stopped working,worked fine for about 6 months. Then randomly stopped working.
1467,5,This is my fourth one That Says It All!,I use these as data drives and as data backup drives. I also use it as a working drive. This saves wear and tear on my main drive.
1468,4,overall not bad,If you have a Mac It won't work unless you format it with Disk Utility. Format option on right click not available on Mac. Otherwise its preloaded with back up .exe file
1469,5,It works!,Excellent for backups!
1470,5,It’s perfect for my ps4,"There have been two unexpected power outages and it has survived them. Before I bought one, I did research in my city and they said it was the best of its kind, but they sold it much more expensive than here."
1471,4,Keeps Disconnecting from M1 MacBook,"I am having issues with this product dropping from my M1 MacBook.I am not sure if it is the hard drive or the MacBook is the issue, that is why I did not give a lower ranking.Also, it does not ship with a USB-c cable and you will need to either buy an adapter or a new cable."
1472,1,Super slow!,"I have a few external drives for the backup. This one is particularly very very slow. Just opening a folder takes a lot of time. Frankly, most of the time I gave up browsing its content. It was not that slow for the first few months, but now it's just not usable. Very dissatisfied."
1473,1,***DOES NOT WORK ON MAC***,"Product description says Mac compatible, once plugged in and opened there is a file that says its only compatible on Windows. Very dissatisfied. Mac users beware"
1474,1,They are a scam product cheap,Product is very cheap I tried returning it since May 2 now its june 24th and they haven’t refunded me yet
1475,1,Broke,Broke within 3 months. Unusable.
1476,3,Thought it was SSD. It is actually HDD,OK to use but prefer SSD and then it require an apps to recognized on Mac
1477,5,Storage works,I love that it last!
1478,1,UPDATE:Drive is good.,"Initially received drive and connected it to computer only to see it shows it only has 16.3 TB of space.Confirmed this is an issue with Windows and that drive is actually 18TB.So far, it works great, as advertised."
1479,2,"Not dependable, expect to buy another....","Lasted about 1 year & failed.Since then (about another year) been using SDXC card & now that failed too.What junk they're selling these day's!?!?Got new SDXC card, working perfectly....today anyways."
1480,5,A must needed device,"I ordered the Seagate 1 TB storage, and I’m still trying to fill the entire device. This device holds so much storage, and is a must have. I will purchase this product again"
1481,1,I missed the return window,By the time I got around to it and took it out of the box I found out that it only works with a USB 3 not USB 2
1482,5,"High quality, low cost.Rough handled throughout the world, never failed.","I have purchased many, many of these externals.Every out-of-country project, I buy two, one for me to carry, one for the producer.Sponsors spend thousands of dollars on the projects, I will not fail due some disk drive malfunction.As our projects only run approximately 30 minutes on TV, a 2tB external will carry the video of three video cameras, a cellphone,USB text.Everything.Never a failure.Inexpensive, value far beyond the few dollars."
1483,1,False advertisement,"Does not support playstation, when in the description it says it does. I bought this for my son and his PS4 says this device is not supported 👎🏼 waist of money I’m returning it."
1484,1,It crashed the first time I used it.,I was downloading a large amount of data on to it and it crashed halfway through.It was the first time I used it.
1485,5,reliable external hard drive,great external hard drive that I currently use as storage for my playstation 5 games and content. I no longer need to worry about running out of storage space on my PS5 and need to delete data.
1486,5,Quality,The portable 2 TB hard drive was easy to use and transport from computer to video game system.It has amazing storage and is easy to connect to most devices.
1487,5,Talk about getting the Job DONE!,This is working out great in terms of space and portability.I was able to clear my computer of all my graphic design work and switch the work to my laptop when needed.This proved to be a great extra storage device and well worth the price for the space you will enjoy
1488,1,worked the first week now constantly has problems,"I bought this to download my pictures from google photos.. it worked for a week and now it has nothing but issues finding the photos i put in there, constant errorsfrustrating as heck"
1489,5,Good product,Eventhough when it's not a SSD is Fastener to transfer files comparing with the old that I had
1490,5,Works as well as any,There’s really nothing to dislike. It plugs right in usb and works just like it should. Haven’t had any problems or issues.
1491,1,3 months!!!,Lasted all of 3 months. This wss only used for an xbox 1 that gets played maybe twice a week.
1492,1,Very slow write speeds even when writing very large files sequentially (<20MB/s),"I thought I'd take a chance on an SMR drive for archival storage of large video files (~5GB each).SMR is supposed to be terrible at random writes but just merely poor at large sequential writes.WRONG!This drive, on USB 3.0, writes at 20MB/s dropping down to 15MB/s from time to time.Hour after hour.Starting from an empty drive.No file reads, no file deletes, no file rewrites, just writing one file sequentially after another.It's just terrible.Other HDDs - CMR! - e.g., Seagate EXOS via a USB 3.0 dock - on this same system write at ~80MB/s.I wanted an external drive with high capacity in a ""proper"" case.And not too expensive.It was a mistake to get this product.(And WD products have worse reviews...)From now on I'm going back to the more expensive approach I used before this failed experiment:Pop a enterprise HDD - e.g., Seagate EXOS - into a dock and claim the ""raw"" look of a naked drive on my shelf is just what I wanted."
1493,2,Device is trash,Stop working after a year and a half. Don’t waste your money.
1494,1,I bought a new drive a while back my wife just used it and it had files from 2018.,This is not right to pay for a new unused drive have files from 2018. I’m going to contact Amazon and ask what they can do. Just not right.
1495,5,Very satisfied,Bought it for my grandson he loves it
1496,5,External hard drive magic!,Great bargain!
1497,5,a must have,glad i got this one i can store so much on one drive its crazy
1498,1,Didn't work when I got it!,Product didn't work when received.
1499,5,Easy to use and a great price,I bought this for my Xbox and ended up buying a second for my PS4 within a week. It expanded our storage and was very easy to use. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is easily moved if needed.
1500,5,Great little drive.,"Works well, plug and play as always.Great little drive."
1501,2,Slow!,"Very slow! Almost unusable. Also has an unusual cable type, so you won't find replacement cables anywhere but online. Otherwise okay."
1502,5,So far so good,I have my own business and I have been using the drive to back up my data in case my PC crashes. It seems to work very well so far.
1503,5,Works with Xbox Series S,"Bought for my Xbox series S because It does not come with very much storage. I got 2 terabytes and it was well worth the price. Only downside is that you can not run next gen games from it, but I knew this before hand so it is okay. The process of setting it up is easy, just plug it in and push a few buttons."
1504,1,Get Another portable harddrive.,Mine stop working completely.It started making a beeping sound. I had this item on a secured spot on my desk. Will get another from a different brand.
1505,5,Best portable backup,"This is my 2nd purchase of my main backup in 5 years. Have ever had a failure. This drive is the fastest for all my backups, Windows & Linux both."
1506,1,MAC Incompatible,Despite its claims this product does not work on apple products.
1507,5,Satisfied,"I needed a hard drive on the fly for an editing class at school. After purchasing, it was super easy to reconfigure and serves its purpose well! As a college student, I carry it everywhere and it's just the right size to be portable."
1508,1,NOT FOR MACS DO NOT BUY,the listing says its for macs and is not for macs
1509,1,Back Up Drive Failed,"The Sea Gate product failed shortly after purchase. It is still under warranty. The support tech person said the drive failed and they will replace it. However, I am wasting time with customer service as they want to charge me to send a replacement drive. Horrible service. They finally agreed to send a replacement drive .... and then cancelled the replacement drive without explanation! Very frustrating."
1510,5,Instructions could be better but it works well.,Instructions could be better but it works well.
1511,5,Son loves it,What he asked for!
1512,5,Best purchase,Couldn’t get better.
1513,5,"How this hard drive can be used with desktop, iPad and iPhone.","I’m in the process of organizing my digital photos which involves transferring data from iPhone, iPad, desktop, laptop, and flash drives. I’m not ready just yet to put photos on this hard drive but expect no problems and I’m sure I’ll have ample storage."
1514,5,Lots of Storage,Great storage. It is like having your own cloud storage.
1515,1,not portable.,"bought this as replacement for broken harddrive, this one broke within 6 months. very disappointing to lose my work again. do not recommend."
1516,5,"Nice, portable and fast!","Nice and fast, portable and easy to use."
1517,5,does what it is supposed to do,"Not an exciting product, which is exactly what you want. You plug it in and it stores your data."
1518,1,Crashed,Crashed as first uses. Would never buy again.
1519,1,bought new got a used one,bought new got a used one had someone elses games even though i bought it new
1520,5,So far works fine,"ESSENTIAL!Look up on You Tube or Goggle on how to format this external hard drive for your Mac or PC.Its very simple.Just takes a couple steps. The You Tubers of course like to talk and carry on.It takes more time to get the simple instructions than it does to carry them out.Yes it quietly clicks and buzzes like an electronic insect.Its not an expensive silent solid state hard drive with a couple terabits. Its an old fashion spinning hard drive with whole lot of terabits. Unplug it when you are not using it.Save wear, less chance for future failure.Simple logic...... A moving hard drive ought to not be not moving when not in use. Would would you leave your car running on idle all night?I don't think so!"
1521,1,why isn't zero stars an option,"Absolute trash. Broke after 3 months of minimal use. No bumps, no drops. It's been stationary since I first plugged it in. Computer detects drive but won't display any information. When I try to open it or format it, it says drive not accessible. So bad!"
1522,5,Works great!,My laptop was so full of garbage files and family pictures that I couldn’t even empty my trash to free up space. This external hard drive has allowed me to delete so many photos while still keeping the all my garbage files.
1523,5,Good product,Purchased the Seagate after a no name brand didn’t work. The Seagate works great.
1524,5,Great product!,"This portable Hard Drive was everything I needed. I had trouble at first because I have a Mac and not a Microsoft computer. Didn't take me long to figure out how to change things, thanks to the tech support."
1525,1,Worked for a month and then stopped working,Not worth the money at all worked for a short time and stopped working
1526,5,Work great,Works great
1527,1,it doesn't work with mac,i ordered it specifically for my apple computer and it doesn't work with it
1528,5,Small but holds a lot,I have been using this to store my pictures and videos from my phone and it holds a lot! Very easy to use and so small and sleek easy to store!
1529,1,Completely didn't work with my PS4,It refuses to connect to my PS4 and I couldn't get the time to return it so I'm just stuck with this junk
1530,1,Drive is failing within a month,"I just got this drive for some personal media. Right away the drive started failing. I have a couple videos on the drive and any time I try to read/write data to the drive it crashes and ejects itself, and I can't get it to work properly. Have tried on multiple windows computers, and also changed the cords out."
1531,4,Quite Slow,"took about 20 minutes to transfer 5 GBs of photos onto the drive, which sucks because I'm trying to use it as a backup for a total of 240 GBs of photos I have on several flash drives. It's going to take a long while to get all of these transferred :("
1532,1,Beware Amazon,If you buy this product with installments beware. I was charged full price then passed around like a hot potato for two hours with no notice why I was being transfered. Then my phone was auto blocking the “specialist”. Super sketchy
1533,5,Great inexpensive 2 TB drive.,"Needed to reformat for my Mac to use with Time Machine, but Time Machine took care of this step. Also, needed an adapter for my iMac."
1534,5,Lots of storage capability,My husband is using this for more photography picture storage.Very happy.
1535,2,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my son Two months and it has went out already. Now all of his stuff is gone. First it started blinking, then it stopped loading the games, and lastly it just stopped. I should’ve just went in the store. And also got protected. I atleast thought it would last a year."
1536,1,Misleading! Does not work for PS5!,The description of this product is misleading! The correct name for this product is Seagate Backup Plus Hub. If I saw that anywhere in the description I would not have ordered because I got this item for the intended purpose of using it for my PS5. On Seagate's website it clearly says this item is not compatible with any Playstation. Fix the description so others do not make the same mistake.
1537,5,Exactly what I needed!,"Perfect hard drive for any purpose. Of course, get the capacity you need for your files, but it works brilliantly."
1538,5,Bought as a PS4 external drive. Works great.,My PlayStation 4 was constantly getting full. I had a 500gb external that still wasn’t enough. So far this works well and I’m sure will probably outlast my outdated gaming system.
1539,1,It won't work at all with my older iMac,Paperweight.
1540,1,DO NOT BUY. PC DOES NOT READ THESE,"Purchased this after my external hard drive started clicking.This new hard drive worked until I started transferring files onto it. Reached out to seagate and they walked me through the steps and finally agreed that it was corrupt.I had to pay 30 dollars to return it for a different one. Shipping cost plus static bag.I received my new hard drive 2 weeks later and again it worked until I transferred files onto it. Now my computer wont read this new one.I have tried different computers, different cords, and everything in between. Seagate walked me through their steps and the hard drive will not work.Wasted $140 dollars in total for a paperweight.DO NOT BUY SEAGATE"
1541,1,Terrible quality,Terrible! Stopped working right away and I lost all of my work as a result!
1542,5,Good quality,Bought this 2 years ago and is still working but somehow got write protect on it?
1543,5,Powered on 24/7,These have been going 1/2 a year so far constantly running on my pi nas I haven't had any issues with them yet.
1544,5,Gift,I bought it for my boyfriend. He asked for it.
1545,1,SUCKS,"It SUCKS. It's supposed to be 5TB, but it's NOT. Storage is terrible, it couldn't even hold 200 pictures. I was too busy to use it til now. 0 star, but i had to give it a 1."
1546,4,Great item for playstation just one problem,The device is really great and holds a ton of storage but sometimes when connected to my PlayStation it will disconnect and give an error warning. It's really easy to fix but other then that it's great.
1547,5,What can I say. They work or don’t,This one works!
1548,2,Didn't last long,The drive was dead in less then 4 months.
1549,5,Did it's job of storage! 2TB.,"It came quickly as promised. My local tech support saved all my important information on it.Just a note:Dell was incorrect about many issues. My tech support solved my issues, not Dell support."
1550,5,Perfect time machine,Reformat for Mac and let it rip. No need to keep the included dashboard software-it will slow everything down. Get a new one to back it up once every couple of years.
1551,1,"Not a 4GB, Received a 2GB",Was not as advertised. Only option is to return it but I already loaded my stuff on it.
1552,4,"Not Solid State Drive!!! The Title description says HDD,","The Title description say HDD, That means ""Hard Disk Drive"".SSD means ""Solid State Drive"". I've read a lot of the reviews saying it's a Solid State. It's not. I'm not sure why there's confusion aboutit. I haven't used it yet but I'm sure it's fine for my needs. I'll use it for large art files. I'll let you now if it messes up in the next month."
1553,3,Failed inside of 2 years,I have 2 of these. Used every day for pc tech customer data storage. One failed inside of 2 years time. I knew better than to buy sea gate but the price was good. Buy WD!
1554,1,Does NOT work with MAC,Does not work with MAC
1555,1,Failed within 3 Months and Lost everything,Very disappointed with this drive. Waste of money and lost all of my important video files. No I have a paper weight and lost so much. Do not buy. I knew I should have bought a SSD.
1556,5,What a life saver!,"I had my laptop crash on me but luckily due to some quick trouble shooting I was able to get into the dos mode and move all my files to this lovely little device! And oh my gosh, even backing up 12 years of documents it barely put a dent in the overall capacity! Plus this is so speak, small and can fit into any briefcase setup you have! Maybe there is something better out there but for the price and quality seagate offers I couldn’t be happier!"
1557,5,Bought as a gift,Son loves his extra storage for his ps4
1558,2,It simply does not work if it is not connected DIRECTLY to the desktop computer !!,"I never got any HDD in a plain brown box. The desktop computer did not recognize it. Only after a boot it recognized it. File transfer stopped in the middle. Cannot read the files already transfered.It is to late to return it.Current status: inert brickConnected via a USB3 Hub it performed miserably but... when I connected it directly to the computer it started to work ""normally"""
1559,5,Perfect purchase,My son needed additional xbox storage. Loves it!
1560,5,Works right out of the box,"No issues with this product, I had a Western Digital Passport that bricked on me after 4 months of use. Had to get a replacement, which was this Seagate, so far so good. No issues with it."
1561,5,Wohoo,The media could not be loaded.
1562,4,Like it,"Nice size, easy to use, good price for the amt. of storage"
1563,1,Do not buy if your using it for work related storage,"So far so bad, I'm using this hard drive to save photoshop projects for work I have no idea how 80% of the files I've saved on this hard drive don't save correctly. I have to re-do all my work I haven't tried saving any images music or any other files it's been exclusively for photoshop work and ohh man it's a pain when I work on something save it to this hard I was to open it up again and the files are basically useless cant open in any other software or are salvageable it has to be this hard drive I've never had issues with, Western Digital hard drives, just this one.I would stay away if you are using it to save photoshop files."
1564,5,Working great,Great product for a great price save so much space on my xbox series x hard drive loving it
1565,4,Great deal,Bought one for my Xbox series S and it’s a great steal in comparison to Xbox’s complete rip-off of a $200 dollar hard drive. A little bit confusing on separating Next gen/Current gen between Internal drive and the hard drive. But otherwise a 10/10 purchase
1566,5,INEXPENSIVE 1 TB BACKUP & PORTABILITY VIA USB CONNECTION,INEXPENSIVE 1 TB BACKUP & PORTABILITY VIA USB CONNECTION
1567,1,"Dies after one year of use, Product getting worse.","Bought this hard drive in 4TB to use with my laptop. Worked fine for one year, then totally bricked out very shortly after the one year warrantee.Lost 3TB worth of important data. If you are considering this product, sort the reviews by 'Most Recent' and you can get a better understanding of the current quality of the product. Definitely feels like planned obsolescence, especially after giving up the ghost so shortly after the warrantee expires.I was told Solid State Drives are a better option than these, so thats where I will be going next!"
1568,1,Doesn’t work,I bought this to back up my laptop so I can get it repaired to find out it’s not connecting to any of my computers.I’ve tried three different computer and 8 different cords and it’s not showing up on anything. I went to the brand website to find any solutions and nothing worked
1569,5,Easy to Use,This hard drive was so easy to use. My first time owning one and the whole process is seamless. I’ve recommended it to others already.
1570,5,Works with my PS5,"Works perfectly fine with my PS5. Only one plug, straight to the back of my PS5. Just plug it in, and let the system format it, done. It’s ready to be loaded. Super simple and easy to use."
1571,5,Using Disk Utility-Made both disks Mac. Works great.,Love them....backup drives.
1572,1,does not work with MAC as advertised,"I am beyond Livid, I am in a tight schedule and ordered this har drive, it said it was compatible with Mac IT IS NOT YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO FORMAT IT OR SOMETHING IT DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC, I needed something that I could just plug in and go like the Samsung one, this is TERRIBLE do not buy.If I could give it MINUS STARS I would had."
1573,5,Great deal,If u need more memory this is definitely the way to go! Got mine super happy with the results
1574,5,fits in ps4 usb connector,very goodstorage for ps4 and worth the price. I had this for a year and i still have 3 tb left
1575,5,As Expected,"Works just as intended, you just plug it in and give permission and it automatically starts storing things, no technical problems whatsoever. 5/5"
1576,5,Excelente compra,Hasta ahora muy buena compra
1577,5,It Works Like It Should,Can add and retrieve items with no problems and with no lag in speed.
1578,1,Continuously asked to re-format. Not good with Xbox,"I have had to reformat three times deleting all my games. The reviews and post said it worked with xBox, yet I keep have issues when using it with my Xbox. Frustrated!!! Don’t buy!!"
1579,1,Doesn’t work. Just keeps telling us to repair the hard drive,Doesn’t work. Keeps telling us to repair the hard drive and when we do it keeps saying to repair again
1580,5,It’s good,Works Great on my xbox one s.
1581,2,"Been having trouble connecting to my Mac, it’s takes a little time before my Mac could read it","Been having trouble connecting to my Mac, it’s takes a little time before my Mac could read it"
1582,1,Won't maintain connection,Having a lit of trouble maintaining connection to my pc.Keeps uncoupling. If anyone has a fix please let me know
1583,1,FILES LOST DO NOT BUY,Thought this would be a great product until I used it a few times. It says I have several Time Machine backups but there are no files and I cannot seem to recover them. I've had this for maybe three months and it's useless. Never again.
1584,1,Not compatible with mac,can't even use it on a mac
1585,1,Not even compatible with new XBOX… waste of money,Wish I could get a refund for this profit because it’s useless — should have disclaimer saying this will not work with new XBOX systems as external hard drive for memory!!
1586,5,Easy As 123,Easy As 1231) Plug it to your PS5 (I got it for my PS5)2) Go To Settings and Format it3) Sit Back And Enjoy
1587,5,Awesome glad to have it,"Small ,one cable more space"
1588,1,Not described accurately,Description claimed it was compatible with MAC. It was not and no way to re-format.
1589,1,The hardrive crashed and stoped working after a month.,The hardrive crashed and stoped working after a month.
1590,2,Every time Mac updated the OS storage stops working.,"I purchased the item in February. This was a replacement for my old Seagate storage that stopped working after Mac OS update. Same thing happed after the last update 2 days ago. Every time Mac updated the OS storage stops working. The storage becomes inaccessible for writing. The company has very good tech support but unfortunately, there is a bug they were not able to fix. Very disappointed."
1591,1,Not mac compatible,"The product that was sent to me only had an execution file for machines running microsoft windows. It would not accept files from my mac computer, and there was no clear avenue to get it to."
1592,1,Absurdly SLOW,"While the drive works and does all the things someone might expect, the quickest I've been able to transfer is 20MS/s or about 1/5th the speed of other drives. I bought this in an emergency to backup a failing drive, but the transfer rate is taking DAYS instead of hours."
1593,4,Easy to use,An easy to use portable external hard drive. Decent speed when transferring files. Holds a good amount of data.
1594,1,"Faulty device for Macs, not good for Time Machine","My Mac mini has been having the occasional issue since I got this. I never really associated it as the culprit, but just debugged with Apple and this device does something on the USB channels that causes kernel panics. It's always been slow, but it can eventually get into some mode where it seems to just stop responding and causes the kernel to panic. I've not figured this out 4 months after my warranty expired. :) the 5TB storage for the low price was too good to be true. Never gonna do Seagate again."
1595,5,Back up drive,Good compact design. plug and play easy to use.stores all my important files.
1596,5,Works flawless!,"Great HDD, it works without any issue. The transfer speed is excellent."
1597,1,Barely made it a year before failing entirely.,"The drive worked fine for a while, but at just 13 months it's now completely dead. Really frustrating."
1598,2,Exos x18 7200rpm drive with only a one year USA warranty in a USB case.,Exos x18 - 18tb 7200rpm drive with a one year USA warranty in a USB case.Super fast(using USB 3.0 port) 7200rpm Exos x18 SATA/600 drive using a USB adapter in a case.Super loud 'enterprise' class drive that probably doesn't belong in a portable drive case on the desktop.Comes with a one year warranty in North America and up to 3 years elsewhere.Also has one year of rescue data recovery serviceThe bare internal Exos x18 drives come with 5 years warranty and you can buy 3 years rescue data recovery for $15 so this Seagate 18tb Expansion HDD is of questionable value if you live in North America.
1599,5,Super easy to install!,"I love how much space this added to my console, it runs so much faster. However, I do recommend SD drive if u can afford it, the transfer rate is kinda slow but it's worth the price."
1600,5,The Dish Wally likes it,"I wanted one for my Wally so I can have DVR as well as longer depth of program guide.Couldn’t be easier install, plug it in, allow it to format and activate EHD and optionally DVR with Dish.This one is a no brainer and just works."
1601,5,Great little game date box,Great little box still trying to fill it up im at 169 games and still have space for more games and date
1602,5,Muy buen producto,"El producto me encanto muy buena calidad, completamente nuevo"
1603,5,Awesome product,I love that it's portable and the amount of storage
1604,1,"It's really, really loud","Sound is vibrating, humming and plusing on the desk. Way too loud. After two day, it's have errror message and wouldn't show up in usb drive. After 24hr at error checking and still not working, I've gave up"
1605,1,Stopped working,Lost all data. Stopped working suddenly.
1606,1,Data Became Unreadable After 2 Weeks,My data is unreadable now. Gone. Poof.Seriously I was about to make a backup and that's when it conked out. So all my art resources are GONE.I do not suggest this!
1607,5,So far so good,"So far it works like a charm. I needed an upgrade from a terabyte hard drive that I've been using since 2013. Not only is this double the storage space, but it's the same size as my old hard drive. Which was pretty small. And it's even faster at moving files! When I was moving files over, it took 20 minutes to move 80 gigs off of my old hard drive, and only took maybe 10 minutes to move them to this one."
1608,5,Great Thing in a Small Package,"I realized my wife had not backed up her MacBook for a long, long time. Why not? Her back-up drive was the size of a dictionary, needed to be plugged into the wall as well as the laptop -- and was almost full! I ordered this tiny 1TB drive that morning. Amazon delivered it in the afternoon of the same day. Plug & Play. It was backing up her data within minutes of arriving. It's small enough to stay connected without ever being in her way. Her back-ups now stay up-to-date. Yay!"
1609,5,Life support for an aging desk-top.,"My guru likes it.My desktop's backup is backing up again.*sigh* Whatever this is, it works!"
1610,1,Trash,I usually don't like leaving negative reviews but this drive was a waste of time. Won't unmount or do anything to be able to format it. Keeps giving errors so it's essentially useless
1611,1,dont buy this!,i got this on december 10 of 2020 and its failed so a year later and some months failed me. I lost everything it got so hot it started a fire and melted the plastic case around it. buy somthing else
1612,5,Perfect,Perfect
1613,5,The Best Deal for a Reliable drive,Seagate has always worked best for me and this arrived on my doorstep the day I order it and has been chugging along ever since. Great price for a great drive.
1614,5,does the job :),"rarely do i write reviews for items, but this drive has kept my little photo and video business running for 2+ years. dependable and does the job for a fair price. definitely recommend."
1615,4,it's what you paid for.,"product came in a small brown box, but seemed to be new. plugged right into my pc and worked (windows 11)so far it is kinda slow downloading wise but not too bad. its better than nothing!"
1616,5,This is a good brand.,About this item because the name has a great reputation.
1617,3,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this to use as a Time Machine backup for my Mac, but after repeated attempts to reformat (per instructions, as APFS with GUID partition), the drive would inevitably develop issues that rendered it unreadable and unusable. I've used other Seagate drives on my Mac without issue, so I have to conclude the specific item I received was defective."
1618,1,not working,Just received this device and I am unable to drag and drop anything to the drive.The Mac'start here' tab states it is damaged or incomplete.extremely frustrated.
1619,5,As advertised.,Using this product as a backup drive.
1620,1,Does not work with MAC OS,Does not work with MAC OS as advertised. Waste of time. My client is waiting for the files.
1621,1,don’t buy,I received the product and it didn’t work or even show up on my Mac desktop and it’s past the return due dateI was so busy I forgotTerrible product!!!!
1622,5,Works as intended,"The storage box worked just fine and plugged right into my Xbox and added the correct space, and I still have enough space for everything."
1623,2,Arrived damaged,The USB port connection was off center so It was very difficult to plug it in.When I was able to plug it in the connector kept falling out…🙄 ordered a WD in its place!!
1624,1,advertised for Mac but formatted for Windows NT File System,"I bought it for Mac and it says it can not be used with Mac.It is formatted for windows NT file System and I do not have Windows on my Mac. No instructions how to change the format even if it is possible.No manual, etc.Not useful for an older, computer un-savvyperson like me, who does not have much help from younger generation."
1625,5,Awesome,I will purchase again
1626,1,NOT COMPATIBLE FOR MAC,FALSE ADVERTISING. this doesn't work for Macbooks!
1627,1,Seagat hard drive,"I'm having a problem with my Seagat hard drive that I purchase.Because of the problem I sent an e-mail to Seagat for help, as follow:Quote:Hi - I want to bring to your attention the problem I have with purchasing the Seagate hard drive. On March 10, 2022 I went online to purchasing the Seagate hard drive & when I received it though the mail I proceeded to download documents & photos to it with no problem BUT all of a sudden it went dead.For some reason or other I can't access it on my computer. i try accessing the hard drive on different computer USB inserts & with a different computer, no help.Can you help me on this problem?UnquaoteI have not receive a reply thus the reason I'm submitting this complaint & to warn future people of thing of buying this hard drive."
1628,1,Worked for An Hour and A Half,The external worked very very briefly and then began to automatically disconnect itself whenever I performed an data transfers. As a PS4 user this is a nightmare and I lost 8 game files. My copy of this model was not good at all and the rescue warranty is too convoluted and indirect to have any real worth. Save your money!
1629,1,Drives break immediately - despite being “portable” they are not meant to be moved,"These drives both broke within 2 months of starting to use each of them.I store them safely in a padded computer bag, but regardless, within a short period of time each of the 2 I bought stopped connecting to the computer.Customer service is difficult to work with and will give you the run around on getting the data recovered.I am sending them both out for data recovery, so we’ll see if I’m able to get anything saved."
1630,5,"Good, Solid External HDD","I bought this External HDD to use with my new PS5, and it works wonderfully.I keep all of my PS4 games stored on this external drive to save room on the console's internal SSD for the PS5 games (which can only be run from the internal SSD) and I haven't noticed any significant load-time slowdowns as opposed to the SSD.I already have a 1 terabyte model I use to store music and video files, and I was originally going to purchase a 5 terabyte model for about $110 to use with my new PS5, but I decided that 2 terabytes was fine for my current needs.The 5 terabyte model is also an excellent deal (just five years ago i would have thought 5 terabytes of storage for only 110 bucks was completely insane!) and I may decide to get an additional 5 terabyte model in a few months, and repurpose my 2 terabyte drive for something else.In a month or two I plan on buying a 2 terabyte internal SSD to install as a second drive in my PS5, and having both a 2 terabyte Internal SSD AND a 5 terabyte External HDD should future-proof my PS5 console for quite a while as far as storage space goes.This 2 Terabyte External HDD works wonderfully; I have loaded it up with all of my current PS4 games and still have a full terabyte left, and I have not noticed any loading slowdown on any of my PS4 games installed on it, including DooM (2016), Spider-Man, and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night."
1631,5,Works very well,This works very good !
1632,5,A very useful purchase,"I bought the 2TB HDD for my Xbox Series S and it was a really good purchase. I have installed all the games that are not X|S optimized, and the games runs and looks good."
1633,1,Doesn’t work on Xbox,It is not USB 3.0
1634,4,Good for the moneh,The only reason I gave it 4 stars sometimes it won’t read and I have to unplug it for a second and plug it back in
1635,1,Died shortly after purchase,Maybe my ZEN ASUS i910980HK leaned on it too hard
1636,5,Definitely recommend,Got this because I was tired of constantly have to decide what game I would delete whenever I wanted to play something new. Definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of how easy it was to use and I've put around 18 full games on it with plenty of storage left
1637,5,Simple!,Plug and play works great! Save time and money! Super fast transfer speeds and small enough to carry anywhere!
1638,1,DOES NOT WORK ON MAC,"Though the title claims it’s compatible with Mac, it actually has permission related issues that cannot be resolved, which renders it useless. It ships with read only permissions (why you would need this on a storage drive is beyond me) and a windows only .exe file. Beware."
1639,1,drive crashed after 18 months,This is not worth the money; it made a clicking noise and failed after 18 months. Now I have lost everything on this device.
1640,5,Awesome for gamers!,It’s very easy to setup it holds plenty of games. I even got one for my boyfriend and he loves his. It’s really easy to transfer stuff as well. Was definitely worth the money!
1641,1,Dont Buy!,I Have Got two of These Drives in Two Years. They Break like every Four to Six Months.
1642,1,Will not stay connected to computer.,"This product from the start had so many issues. I have a top of the line and gaming computer, and definitely know a lot about computers. This external storage did not stay connected to my computer for more than 20 minutes. I changed 10 different settings to try to fix this. I had no luck. I only put 100 MB of storage into the drive. After that it was impossible to access any of the files or move them back to my main storage. It took me an hour and a half to takeoff everything I stored to return it. It should’ve took me five minutes at the max. Very disappointed I would suggest to spend a little bit more money to buy a better hard drive."
1643,5,2TB of storage ready to go.,"2TBs ready to go. Had to make backups of files as my laptop was running out of storage. With this, I was able to clean up my laptop storage while also keeping my files. Also let me move programs from one PC to another. Great to have this around."
1644,5,Works great!,Use for video storage.
1645,1,"DONT BUY! Terrible Product, Hard Drive Failed after Two Months","Terrible Product, failed after two months. Item is beeping and refuses to connect to any device. Poor build, poor quality, terrible overall. Nothing but garbage. If you purchase this product you are simply asking for your data and files to be lost forever."
1646,5,Great!,Works perfectly for Xbox one.
1647,1,What’s the point? Plastic case is so cheap and THIN,"Um, who was the genius that picked out the housing material for this drive? It’s super thin. I can easily press into it and feel the internal components. I can’t imagine it would hold up to any travel or kids or gravity or water or heat or anything. Trash."
1648,4,"Good value, functional","Good value, functional"
1649,5,Xbox 1s compatible,Works perfect for outer storage space for games just have to format it really quick
1650,5,Damn Good Storage,As advertised.I've used Seagate Hard Drives for years and you cannot go wrong with them.Great price and quick delivery!I have been buying seagates for years and have never had one go bad.Good value for the money and dependable as hell.
1651,2,Slower than Molasses,Get ready for waiting for hours for a response from this thing. It stores information but it's almost unusable.
1652,1,Receive wrong drive.,"Received a drive formatted for windows only.I have a mac.The drive that I purchased said that it was formatted for mac.The drive that arrived was for a PC.I am just going to go to Best Buy.Wasted time, never to get back... :)"
1653,5,Compatible,Have had no problem!
1654,5,Good,Works as advertised and great value.
1655,1,Not compatible,"Item was not compatiblewith phone, computer, etc. to be able to move photos to external hard drive. Waste of money."
1656,5,These are really great!,I already have four of them! It tells how much I like them!!
1657,5,Good,Good
1658,5,It works,"I've had it attached to my computer since I bought it for the extra space.I've been able to store loads of video files on it, and I've not run into any problems with it yet.I've used Seagate branded expansions in the past and they had good stuff, and this drive continues to be good."
1659,5,Buena calidad y funciona al 100,El producto tiene buena calidad y fácil de programar
1660,5,Plenty of storage for the price,This unit has been very reliable and provides plenty of storage for the price.
1661,4,I like,I like
1662,5,great for gamers,this was really nice to have. i could have a bunch of games downloaded on it
1663,1,Slowest HDD I have ever owned,I have owned hundreds of hard drives as the owner of a computer repair business. This is the slowest drive I have ever had the displeasure of using. I have only written to this drive four times with four different backups of less than 300Gb and each time it has taken 4+ hours each time to complete. As a comparison the redundant backups I do to other drives take minutes instead of hours.The only reason I didn't return this drive is that the data is sensitive that I wrote to it and I don't want to risk it falling into the wrong hands.Note: This is slower than an old 5400 RPM laptop drive that I have lying around.
1664,5,Works as designed.,"Though listed as a 4 TB, keep in mind that any portable hard drive will give up some space for internal operating systems.Typically you will get 85 to 95 percent of the list storage for actual file storage."
1665,1,NOT FULLY MAC COMPATIBLE,"The description of this product is extremely misleading. It only works with a Mac using an additional application, and even then it will be miles slower than an external with USB C."
1666,5,Great product,Great device
1667,1,Didn’t work,Never charged itself much less my phone while traveling.
1668,1,Not for Mac,Same problem as the other reviewers--this drive isn't formatted for Macs. I could have re-formatted it myself but it seemed like an opportunity for something to go wrong.
1669,5,Producto como se describe,"Cumple con las especificaciones detalladas por el vendedor, disco original."
1670,1,Doesn't Work with Mac,"I bought this because it specifically states it's formatted for both mac and PC, and it doesn't work with my mac at all. The information states formatted for PC only."
1671,1,Doesn’t work with mac books,So aggravated. Says it works with MacBooks; but it doesn’t unless you buy an adapter. Spent $50 and waited almost a week and still can’t even use the thing… AND have to spend even more money.
1672,5,Works well,"Easy way to add tons of space. Small, easy to install and does what it promises"
1673,5,A great buy for the price,Simple put. I needed additional space to backup some files. And i got it. No hassle no incompatibility with my devices. It works just fine. It was also ordered and shipped on time.
1674,1,Broke on first use,I only used it once to do a back up on my computer and now it won't show up anymore and all of my files can no longer be accessed. Years and years of work are gone. They are offering one free data recovery service but they can't guarantee it will be restored and it's going to take up to a month.
1675,5,This was a great price for this size product,Great size for the money.Would buy again
1676,1,"Bad, bad product","I purchased the Seagate Portable 4T external HD less than a yr ago. Took real good care of it and one day it died for reasons of having bad components.I had data on it that I saved nowhere else because this was a new drive and I trusted this company based on stellar reviews, which goes to show how much most of those are worth.I learned the hard way that these companies make junk these days.I used to have all my data on 1 drive and never lost anything for 15 years.Now you have to have backups of backups and have to buy these junk drives every couple of years.Look at the mountain of reviews from people who lost data because these drives died for no reason at all. Bad bad companies! Incompetent, uncaring, dishonest, because they know what they sell and yet present it as safe, durable, the product of new age of advancement and technology...!!!!So, I sent it back to Seagate to recover my data. They said they have a 95% chance of recovery.Sounded good.They did not recover 1 bit and gave me a totally stupid explanation: ""it's difficult to pinpoint the cause of media damage (scratches and rings on the platters)"".Well, who caused those scratches?I never dropped it.It sat immobile on a small table near my computer.Their horrible product broke by itself because of garbage components that break with the gentlest use after a few months.SO I ""thank you"" NOT, Seagate for losing all of my precious data because I trusted a new product from you.To make things ""better"", they sent me an empty replacement drive, which was part of the warranty deal.Only that drive I received is an old refurbished one.Slap on the face.In other words: ""We sold you a bad product that caused you to lose large amounts of your invaluable data, and we take a used drive,returned to us (someone else's refuse) and fixed by us, and we send that to you!""I would tell you to go buy other brands but from the reviews I read, all these companies do a horrible job these days and they do not care.So my advice is to buy multiple cheap drives and replace them frequently.Maybe one day a company that can make good products will appear.Until then, we have to buy products that we dislike and are ashamed of.They should be ashamed of making such products but they are not, obviously!"
1677,3,Stops working efficiently after a few months.,I can’t say don’t buy because it did it’s job for a little while. I noticed I had to wipe it a few times. I’m a gamer so it was really annoying to have to do this. The drive crashes my pc whenever hooked up. Wish it had more life
1678,5,Just what my son needed,Came as described so far so good worth the purchase
1679,1,DO NOT BUY!,"This hard drive keeps crapping out on me!!! I try to use it and it works for a little bit and then ejects itself without warning! To make matters worse, you can't just unplug and plug it back in! It has to rest for a few minutes like the primadonna piece of crap it is. Please for the love of God, if you value your time and your work, DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1680,1,Keeps disconnecting for no reason,"While loading it with footage it just disconnects, only when im putting files on it, DOES NOT WORK! every other storage devoce works fine this one blows."
1681,5,"It was perfect for me, because of all of my PS4 games.","I have 35 PS4 games and a 1TB console, that wasn't enough. So I bought the device, moved all the data to it, and haven't used all the space on it and memory is basically free on my PS4. I love it."
1682,5,Works with Fire Recast,"I bought this 2 Tb drive to expand storage on my 500 Gb Fire Recast. I plugged it into the USB port on the back of the Recast, then restarted the Recast. I also had to restart my Fire TV stick 4k to reconnect with the Recast. I then got a message did I want to use the drive to expand storage. I clicked on OK, and after a couple of minutes, the drive was ready to go! I now have 2400 gb storage, so I'm very satisfied. I'll update if any problems occur in future. Hope this helps someone, as I had trouble finding current info on which drive would work with the Recast."
1683,4,Fantastic buy for anyone wanting to keep their files safe,"Comes with easy-to-use item register for warranty, plenty of storage space, cable included, and small sturdy case"
1684,5,Xbox one,Plugged into Xbox one recognized it immediately and boom 1T of free storage.
1685,5,PRECONFIGURED AND REAEDY TO GO,INSTRUCTIONS ARE TOO SMALL TPO READ
1686,5,Works perfectly with Raspberry Pi NAS,"This thing plugged right in to my Raspberry Pi 3B and worked immediately.I plugged it into a windows machine to quickly transfer some files, then plugged it back into the Pi.I got the 2TB model and already filled up half of it.Using the Pi as an NFS server, I was able to transfer 700+ pictures over the network and store them all on this drive.Very pleased with it so far.Will likely buy more for other projects"
1687,1,It was broken after a few times of usage,I cannot open it on any of my computers after a year and half. I lost all my data and documents that were saved on it. My previous hard drive has been 10 years long and I can still open it and find my data.
1688,4,Great for extra room,Computer needing storage this works awesome taking pictures and programs between work and home.
1689,1,???,does nothing I power up and nothing happens
1690,4,It working fine,"So far so good. I hope it last more than 4-5 years. Thats how long my last one lasted, but it was a later model.Reason for -1 star: I'm still a little sour about my earlier model not working after 4-5 years."
1691,5,so easy,easy to install and good product
1692,5,Gets the job done,"So far, so good.It is doing what I want it to do without any problems.I need it to work for years.Only time will tell.I've used Seagate hardware and software for decades.I can't remember ever having a problem.Hoping this history of excellence continues."
1693,1,junk- defective out of the box,"junk- defective out of the box. just beeped and was not recognized by computer. power is fine, it is a defective unit."
1694,5,perfect,this thing is so convenient I use it every time I go out the only thing it takes pretty long to charge up all the way so if it’s dead it won’t be ready in an hour
1695,5,Muy buen producto super rapida la transferencia de archivos,Muy buen producto super rapida la transferencia de archivos
1696,1,I do not recommend especially if you are going to keep adding more storage.,"I only recommend this hard drive if you put your stuff in it once and will rarely/never use. If you plan to use, edit, and so on I do not recommend. It’s so slow, and it will crash on you. I bought it because “Amazon choice” recommend it to me, butAmazon choice isn’t always the best."
1697,1,Worked for about 30 seconds,Bought it as a Time Machine backup drive for my Mac.My Mac recognized it for about 30 seconds before it couldn't find it any more.Tried a different cable; tried a different computer.No dice.Disk utility could see it but couldn't mount it.Doesn't exactly inspire the confidence one wants in a backup drive.Returned it for a refund.
1698,1,Backup files invisible on drive.,"I tried to check my back up.They took up space on the drive, but they were not visible.Solution from customer support was to reformat the Seagate drive.So just start over. Not at all what I want from a backup drive.Fail."
1699,2,Can’t drag documents in,I just got this drive and can not upload any documents in it. It shows up with a grey circle with a grey line…
1700,5,Great with Xbox Series S :),"The second I plugged it in,my Xbox recognized it as ""Seagate External storage..."", which inspired a lot of confidence in me, right from the beginning. Plays older games great,newer games need to be moved from this drive to internal storage on the Xbox, which it does very quickly,and painlessly."
1701,4,Simple,It's written in simple English for the reader to understand.
1702,2,DON’T USE IT FOR GAMING,"Okay, First of all if you are going to beed a drive for a game don't buy this it is terrible for gaming you can you it for it but i wouldn’t recommend because its a usb portable it isn't meant for gaming and it Constantly freezes."
1703,5,Good,Good storage
1704,1,Segate hard drive,My hard drive stopped working a month after I purchased it
1705,1,Very slow write speeds and has stopped working after 2 years with my new Xbox,Worked decently until it just stopped working for 2 years. Glad I don't care about what's on it. Hope Seagate will manufacturer warranty it but we'll see.
1706,5,Good product,Great for extra media storage
1707,5,Great deal,Price great and delivery promot thank you anazon
1708,5,Clean your PS4!!!,"When I first plugged it in, I got an error on my ps4 saying it’s not compatible. After searching what to do. I found a video saying to clean my ps4. My ps4 before cleaning it was crusty. And when I cleaned it and plugged the hard drive back in, it worked right away.I don’t know how long the hard drive will last but as of right now (may30,2022). It seems to be working perfectly fine."
1709,5,Works great,I plugged it into my USB port and it worked just fine right out of the box. I didn’t need to format it or anything. Lots of storage it’s just drag and drop to place the files. I used it to back up my cloud file storage and free up some space there.
1710,5,Stores stuff,It definitely works.
1711,2,Cheaply made,"I got this for my laptop as I needed a lot of storage for rendering projects, after 3 months of use its flaws really show. Recently it has started to have major connection issues. The connection port on the drive became loose due to the heat it produces (It shouldn't be hot enough to melt frozen wax in a few moments...) and will fall loose and disconnect without looking loose or disconnected. I cannot count the amount of time this has cost me on my projects as it disconnects immediately closing whatever program is accessing the files on the drives (i.e. crashing my programs...) and sometimes corrupting the files altogether. I have tried to contact Seagates customer support but I cant even get past the first step as the they require a serial number that is not even on the product. In short, if you are looking to buy this, don't unless your fine with a 3 month usage period ( Just enough time that the return policy is out the window)."
1712,5,On time delivery,"My office at home.No need to carry paper around, I just scan it in and take it hime."
1713,5,Nice,Nice
1714,5,Enough space to back up everything,We were able to put everything on our old Mac on this drive.
1715,5,PS5 games can not be played directly from hard drive. They must be moved to console.,"The capacity and portability of this item are what I needed, I am very familiar with brand."
1716,5,Faster and Quieter than WD,"Kind of shocking that this is the same price as same-size same-capacity drives from WD, but it's twice as fast (120 MBps compared to 50 to 70) and it's extremely quiet. I bought a couple WD drives and this Seagate thinking they're all the same, but this one is by far the best and I wish all my drives were this one."
1717,5,Small but packs a big punch!,"For a portable drive with a capacity of 5 terabytes and about the size of a mobile phone, this device works perfectly!"
1718,4,perfect for what i needed at the timedata,data storage
1719,5,Works great with Xbox,"I made a critical error some time ago: I purchased the entire Assassins Creed franchise in digital format.Buying them wasn’t the error mind you…they’re each and every one a classic and quite a load of fun.But, I digress…The error arose when Halo Infinite came out.Suddenly, I had no memory on my Xbox.Now, I had completed the entire Ezio collection, AC III, and Black Flag at this point…but I was still working my way though Unity (greatly underrated game) and still had Syndicate and Rogue.Plus, I still had side quests in Origins, Odyssey, and a few in Black Flag left.Needless to say, deleting just wasn’t an option I was entertaining.Enter our titular hero: the Seagate External Hard Drive.I ordered it, plugged it in, quick and easy setup, and the next thing I knew I was happily plowing through Grunts in a Warthog.Job well done Seagate, job well done."
1720,1,Lies about Compatibility,"Don't know why it's saying it's compatible with ps4 when that clearly isn't the case, can't get mine to work with my ps4 no matter what I try, that's a nice $190 down the drain because this listing is a total lie. I'm gonna try some of the other suggestions to get it to work but if I can't then I'm returning this for a different one."
1721,5,Excelente,Almacenar fotografías y vídeo
1722,4,Using on a Mac not straightforward but it does work,"Bought this for backing up files.When initially plugged in, it didn't work as it comes formatted for Windows.Couldn't figure it out until relooked into entire Amazon listing where it does say using on a Mac may require reformatting.One needs to open up disc utilities and then erase the disc (even though it is new) and reformat for the Mac OS.It then worked fine.I had almost returned it, but hope this helps as I probably would have had the same issue if I ordered another one."
1723,4,Not 5T... 4.5T,"The product is advertised as 5T, but in fact only has 4.5T of free space on the drive. 0.5T is ALOT of missing space."
1724,5,Outstanding,Great device
1725,5,Excellent Drive,Excellent drive for extra storage. I use it as a Mac Time Machine backup drive and with a quick re-format to Mac OS it works very well and is very fast.
1726,5,Backup drive that is compact,"Used to backup my video server, need to purchase a few more from them. Great price and shipping was quick."
1727,1,"Old and true, bad and ugly.","I've bought so many seagate hard drives over the years, but this one is bad. Corrupted files, missing files. Sometimes an error check brings them back, but the hard drive is obviously bad from the manufacturer."
1728,5,5 TB Seagate,My external hdd 3 tb is almost full so I need an upgrade. The new hdd is working and I have a lot of free space.
1729,5,Compact,"Works well, I have it for my ps5, lots of space.Won’t play ps5 games from the drive you have to move them over but that’s with every external drive.Lots of space."
1730,2,Not suitable for DVR,"I got it to use as a storage device with Channels DVR Server. Four months later I tracked down the 30 second hangs during playback to corresponding errors in the log likeApr 27 10:48:27 dvr kernel: [4752178.234635] sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#24 uas_eh_abort_handler 0 uas-tag 5 inflight: CMD INApr 27 10:48:27 dvr kernel: [4752178.234661] sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#24 CDB: Read(10) 28 00 5e 4b 20 d0 00 00 08 00Apr 27 10:48:58 dvr kernel: [4752208.951791] scsi host2: uas_eh_device_reset_handler startIt does appear to work eventually, but not in a timely manner."
1731,5,Great product at great price with great tech support,I needed to unlock the drive so that I can drag and drop. I called tech support and they helped. Very knowledgeable
1732,5,"Great speed and capacity, slightly short cable.","Cables are slightly shorter than what I expected, but still plenty.Otherwise a great product. Fast speed and great capacity"
1733,5,It good,It does indeed store data.
1734,1,Didn't Even Last 6 Months,"It worked well when I received it. Was physically gentle with it all the time, didn't let it sit on hot surfaces. Was using it to store music files for DJ library. Did not show up on either PC or Mac after 3 weeks of use despite having it for 6 months. I'm unfortunately past the return period so I'm likely going to have to suck it up and buy another external SSD but from another brand. I tried to give Seagate another try after 12 years since I was gifted an external by them which also failed in under a year. Will never buy from Seagate again ever."
1735,5,"Big drive, great price per Mb!",Its a 7200 rpm seagate drive and works just fine!
1736,1,Not for Mac,It doesn't work for mac. Too late to return.
1737,5,ALl Ok,Come in like a image
1738,5,Good deal for huge storage in a small package,This drive is sleek and stores up to 4 TB of files. Pretty fast when using USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps).
1739,1,Failed twice and lost data,"I purchase this external drive earlier this year. Within the first two weeks, it failed on me. I had Amazon replace it. Now two months later, it failed and I lost all of my data. After speaking to some of my colleagues in the IT industry, they stated that these drives are EXTREMELY unreliable. Do not purchase if you care about your data."
1740,4,"Great Storage, Not the fastest at file transfers","I didnt buy this for the speed already knowing that it is going to be a slow loader, I bought it for the large storage. I have tons of large recordings on my computer and wanted somewhere else to store them so I bought this product. As of now, it is running fine and has plenty of storage space, just not as fast as a normal internal harddrive."
1741,5,I love it very small and portable,"I love it ,it not so easy to rename it it took me a bit to know what I was doing. Other then that it good I love it. I recommend"
1742,5,You can't go wrong with Seagate's external drives.,"I'm a dedicated Seagate customer when it comes to external drives. I've had trouble with WD in the past, but every Seagate drive I've purchased has been fantastic. The read/write speeds are great, the durability is great, and the lifespan is great. I have purchased four external drives from Seagate over the years for backup purposes (a 2tb, 3tb, 4tb, and now this 5tb). The oldest drive, my 2tb external, is from 2011. All of these worked flawlessly over the years and all of them continue to work flawlessly to this day, even though I've long since moved any important files onto other drives for extra safety. This 5tb solid state drive is so small, yet has so much storage, and no more power cord since it's a solid state, I'm very happy. In the short time I've had it, I can tell it's another great product like I've come to expect. Read/write speeds are blazing fast as usual and it feels as durable and well engineered as the rest. I'm very thankful for the quality of these products from Seagate. For my backup and general memory needs, I'll choose no one else."
1743,5,Great product,Best product
1744,1,Don't buy a product with a unique cable,"I should have known better, We all know it would happen - can't find my cable and freakin Seagate uses a proprietary cable, that you can't just go get.It is why Europe passed legislation that forbids companies from selling product without standardized cables.Totally BS. Right now I hate these guys."
1745,1,Dosent work for xbox,
1746,5,Great For Photographers,"There’s so much space on this hard drive, this is a need for photographers. Easy to use I just plugged it in, I also think everyone should reset the disk first to use it because sometimes hard drives will be locked so you can’t add files but once I did that, I was able to transfer all my photos from the laptop to this hard drive. Make sure you get two eventually"
1747,5,Top quality,Price - quality is top notch! Works great with my XBox one! I’ll be buying another soon for my lap top.
1748,5,Seagate is King!,"I've used many external storage devices over the years, Western Digital almost exclusively. At one point many years ago, got a Seagate on sale, and out of all my external drives, it is the only one that hasn't failed. Had a need for more storage, and picked up this 4TB version--exactly the quality and value I've now come to expect from Seagate. These devices are well built and quite fast for external. Don't see myself using anything else at this point!"
1749,5,PlayStation storage,Is used for my husband's play station to add more storage. He has a lot of games and hasnt even put a dent in the storage yet. Easy to set up and use
1750,1,This product did not work with my MacBook Pro 2019.,You can see clearly it says MAC. MY 2019 MacBook Pro did not show this unit on my computer in any manner. Very disappointed .
1751,5,Best HDD,Best HDD Recommend
1752,5,Great storage,The drive is very easy to use and it appears to be well made. It Is the perfect expansion for my PS4
1753,5,Frees up space on PlayStation,"Product work as described, stores content for PS4 games."
1754,5,Great!,device is fantastic
1755,1,DOesnt work for macbook air,I would. like to return it but can't seem to get in contact with them.
1756,5,Great storage,"Nice compact size, has an amazing storage capacity, great price and super for storing your games."
1757,5,Espacio,Tiene gran espacio de almacenamiento
1758,5,Nice,Works with my PS4. No problems so far...
1759,1,External hard drive is not as advertised.,"I tried to format the disk for my Mac, followed all of the instructions and when I got to the last step it said the the disk was not readable by the computer.I contacted Seagate and just got the run-around with their answers.I am returning the device."
1760,5,Good Device,"I really like this device, as it’s perfect for an extra backup for my pictures & music collection."
1761,1,The drive only lasted one week,Drive lasted one week and stopped working. I used the drive to capture my files that were recovered from a failed Western Digital drive that also stopped working. Now my files are lost again.
1762,5,It works fine,I replaced an older backup portable HDD that died with this.It loaded up quickly and is much smaller and quiet. Also this runs off the USB power and not a plug-in transformer.
1763,3,Works as intended. Good purchase and value.,Nice and portable and good size capacity. You’ll love it too. Buy one.
1764,5,It’s a great hd,Works great
1765,3,"Drive is fine, cable is short as H**L though","The drive itself is what you'd expect.Nothing extraordinary, but it's not below average either.It feels well made and moderately rugged, though I don't think I'd want to drop it if avoidable.The speeds seem average and what you'd expect, nothing mindblowing, but it's not a grandma on the road either.What I take offense to is the shortness of the cable.I mean...seriously.In this day and age and they give you a foot at most.For most people who have their towers on the floor, this will most likely not reach.If you're taking this to work, depending on your setup, if you can't set it on the top of your tower, you'll probably have to place it on the floor (just don't step on it).I find it utterly ridiculous that a company can't give you at least a 3' USB cable, especially a company as big as Seagate.This seems to be the norm for all companies and it needs to STOP."
1766,5,Great buy.,Awesome to see the memory open up on my console.Already running better and allowing me to download all my games.
1767,5,does what it's supposed to,I like the drive a lot. It backs up without being prompted.
1768,5,If you need this kind of product then buy this . This is my second one and they work great .,This is my second one and I have only praise and great things to say ....
1769,5,ease of use,"Plug and play. It's as simple as that.As a back-up hard drive, getting it going couldn't have been easier"
1770,1,Could not connect to iMac,Came without the software to connect to iMac. Went to the website and it did not have any software to download. Returned it. One star may be unfair as I have no idea how well it would have worked if I could've used it. I'll buy something else.
1771,1,Don’t buy,"Didn’t work with my Mac, said not supported"
1772,1,Does not store,Storage capacity
1773,2,Died after 2 months,Waste of money!
1774,5,Perfect,Perfect
1775,1,Died after 15 months.Before that had issues as well.,"HD was a little quirky from the start.My son had to reload data off xbox several time.After 15 months of use, it is no longer detected on Xbox or PC.Tried to troubleshoot but cannot get any device to detect it."
1776,5,Nice little hdd,Using it for my Xbox series x
1777,5,Perfect!!,More than enough storage!
1778,4,"tons of storage, you wont need anything else",2 tb is way more than you could honestly need for a ps4 unless you have tons of money and in that case this is perfect for anyone
1779,5,Karaoke songs down loaded price was good came on time thank you,I like the product but will see how long this last. So far so good thank you
1780,4,"Was adequate, but only for use with computer",Didn't like that you could not download phone directly into it.
1781,5,Good product.,"I had bought this item before. I bought it for my office, this time."
1782,4,Heats up a lil but reliable,Im a little worried with how warm it gets but no problems for the past few months
1783,2,Stopped working after 3 days of having it,"I bought this as a extension to my Xbox hard drive. It's ad said it would work so I got it. After plugging it in and let me do the formatting for it I set it to a game format. This worked like a charm for the first 3 days I had this, then afterwards it stopped loading up at all when I turned on my Xbox it wasn't registering the hard drive at all. I tried unplugging and plugging back in. It would pick it back up every once in awhile and then it would just drop it and says nothing was connected. And then connecting it to my PC to see if it would register it won't even register it being connected to the port. In all honesty a waste of money and I wish I would have tried to get my money back but it's too late now"
1784,1,I’m done purchasing Seagate’s,"This is the 3rd and last Seagate I purchase EVER.My 8TB Seagate crashed and I wasn’t able to get my files back.Then the 6TB crashed Losing all the work I had saved on it leaving me in a horrible bind with my customers;Also, cannot be salvaged.3rd Seagate which I purchased for my husband also crashed.We are still waiting on customer support to contact us to see where we need to send it in, but I’m sure we will get the same sob story of, it cannot be salvaged.I’m done with Seagate.Invest your money on something that will not crash on you.It might cost more, but anything else will worth it."
1785,4,Not a full 2TB storage device,1.81TB is still a ton of storage but I'm still getting ripped off by the false advertising. Pretty frustrating. But it works fine and was a great buy. The only problem was that it wasn't a full 2TB hard drive.
1786,5,Very good,I like it
1787,5,Low tech storage..ease of use and it works,"I have pc's that are older, was looking for external storage using older USB.This is it and the orice is right"
1788,5,Perfect for my use case,"I have a modded Wii and I use this to store my Wii and GameCube backups. It worked without a hitch, it just needs to be formatted to FAT32."
1789,5,I love Seagate hard drives!,"As an amateur photographer, I have purchased several Seagate external hard drives over the years.I have (so far!) never had any issues with them, and have been pleased with their durability and storage capacity.I will continue to purchase Seagate when I need one."
1790,5,So far so good,So far this external is working awesome I've had no problems with it on my ps4 my last seagate external was the ps4 seagate game drive and it stopped working after a few months but this one is working awesome so far
1791,5,Works fine,It arrived very quickly and worked right away. Had it for about a month and it hasn't given me a problem.
1792,5,Great drive easy to install,This drive is fast and easy to install. Has not failed yet. much more than stock hdd
1793,4,Excellent storage device works well for xbox series S.,This external hard drive has proven to be very reliable as I've been using it for extended storage on my series S console for quite some time already basically since I got my xbox. Do be aware that newer series X or S games won't be able to run from on the hard drive and need to be on your internal storage to do so. I will say it's very good storage for the price and all your older generation xbox games will run off of it just fine saving you tons of your precious internal storage. Defintely worth picking up if you're low on budget but need the extra space.
1794,5,So small it fits in your hand!,"This doesn't require electricity so data transfer is a bit slower. However, it gets the job done. A light comes on when it's powered up via usb."
1795,5,Small with big capacity,Took it out of the box - plugged it in on my Mac and gave t it to Time Machine.Working fine.
1796,2,Hope it's just me...,"Maybe it's just mine, but it worked fine for about three days. Used it in my Xbox One and then suddenly all files became corrupted and began to muck up the Xbox. Console wouldn't work right until I unplugged the drive and now it won't even appear when plugged into a computer for reformatting. Also have a Toshiba which works flawlessly, shoulda just bought a second one of those. Expected a bit more from Seagate, theire drives are fantastic but I would only recommend this if you are planning on using it with a PC / laptop."
1797,5,Good,Good
1798,1,bad apple?,very hard to transfer files onto for some reason
1799,5,It works perfectly!,It gets the job done and it works perfectly with my PS5
1800,5,Plenty of storage,I bought this to store video on. It works perfectly and frees up my laptops hardrive.
1801,5,Easy-Peasy,"Easy to set up, easy to format.Locate the drive on Disk Utility and format it.It is exceptionally quiet and fast and sits on top of its filled up predecessors next to my Macbook Pro.After reading negative reviews and setting this drive up, it’s obvious the negative reviewers are not familiar with the Apple universe."
1802,4,"EXCELLENT EXTERNAL Drive.......,","EXCELLENT hard drive, VARY HAPPY. worth the price...."
1803,5,"Stunning speed, capacity, easy to use!!","Hooks up to my HP laptop with furnished USB cable and drag and drop files from an SD card in my laptop slot for SD cards, my several year old laptop has only 1 TB hard drive and I am shooting photos by hundreds."
1804,1,DId not work with my computer. Waste of time & money.,DId not work with my computer. Waste of time & money.
1805,5,great for personal use,this brand is very user friendly-- only have to drag and drop the files you want to backup-- super easy to do
1806,5,Great portable HD,This portable HD is great for transporting photos to my clients.
1807,5,Excellent and easy to use. So convenient!,I'm glad I bought it to store all my data.
1808,5,It works,"Got this so my son could add more games to his XBox. It arrived when it was supposed to and does what its supposed to. He's happy, I'm happy."
1809,5,it’s amaIng,i just plugged it in and it works perfectly well for games and other stuff..legit don’t have a single complaint except for download speed but that’s not much of an issue as long as i have space
1810,5,Seagate always produces a good quality product,She gate is always produced a good quality external hard drive and I have purchased a few over the years and have always appreciated the quality and durability of their product.
1811,5,Nice,I bought this one the same time my Friend bought the white PlayStation Seagate. And mine outlasted his. I've had no problems at all with this.
1812,1,Drive died way too soon,I have had this product for a couple of months now and it has been working just fine. I've transferred a bunch of important files onto it and just had it sitting on my desk. It just stopped working one day. Never dropped it or had it in any poor conditions. What's even worse is that my warranty has expired 2 months before the expected expiration date. And now I have no way to recover my files without the risk of further damage to the drive. Thanks seagate.
1813,5,My kid is very happy :),She needed this for more storage and is pleased with the hard drive.
1814,5,Absolute garbage. Stopped working in 6 months. Please DON'T BUY.,"PLEASE, DON'T BUY THIS. Mine is the 5TB version.I read complaints here about this disk and I ignored, believing ""-ok, this is a good deal, people might be exaggerating"". They are not. It is the most lousy and terrible HD that I ever bought in my life.I have a MacBook Pro 2015, and I moved 700Gb of data into it 6 months ago, then I let it sitting in the closet for 4 months. When I tried using it today, the speed was ridiculously slow, around 0.5Mb/s. Yes, 0.5 megabytes per second. It was impossible to retrieve the files, to a point where I gave up on those files and tried to reformat. Same thing, 0.5mb/s. Tried different cables, different computers (I have a windows machine, same thing). I'm pretty sure this thing is broken. Avoid as plague."
1815,5,Thank you for a great product!!!,Great product
1816,1,FAILS in 6 monthes to a year or two around 50% of the time,"I did not buy this through Amazon so I won't get the verified purchase endorsement, I bought it at Costco which actually highly advertises it on their site as well but DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE.Especially don't put anything of value or not backed up somewhere else on this drive because there is a better chance you will lose it than an 18-29 vaccinated person getting Covid.......EVERI honestly will never use anything else but SSD Hard Drives from now on (more$$ and less space) but you will not lose your stuff.This last drive was meticulously taken care of, I bought a good solid drive case,(which I love)https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q59EQ3C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1When I took it out it was on a desk, was never dropped, knocked, spilled on, sudden loss of power and when finished was put back in the case, stored safely from heat/cold/moisture, etc.The only thing I can think of is that I used it a lot initially, transferring about 2 TB of content within a week so, so the head may have been getting a bit of a work out but it was not 24/7 and it was not all at once, so it had time for the heads return properly and not impact the platters which I know is a common reason for failures.Under 6 months and gone, sorry but absolutely unacceptable and this being the THIRD time in 10 years, obviously I will never purchase a Seagate or any non SSD drive again (Yeah I know, ""Fool me once / fool me twice"" saying) but I want to keep others from losing something potentially precious and vital just to save a few bucks or have to settle for less space and have multiple drives but clearly there is a reason for that and its' the other all to famous adage ""You get what you pay for""."
1817,3,Not for Xbox users!!,"If you are using an Xbox, I use series S, then you cannot play games optimized for series x/s when downloaded on this drive. When you download a game onto this drive it will say that newer games are not optimized for this hardrive etc. However, if most of your large games ie rdr2, gta, halo, COD, are not optimized for x/s, I recommend this drive"
1818,1,BOUGHT TO EXPAND MY SMART TV'S MEMORY-- DOESN'T WORK!,"I bought this item to expand my memory/storage capacity on my smart TV and its useless, I can't do anything with it, it doesn't work, I've formatted it multiple times and it simply won't allow me to do a damn thing! I've tried everything and it's a complete waste of money! Wish I could get a refund! SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS!!!"
1819,5,Works great,"My old 1 TB Seagate External Drive developed an issue of some sort and would not allow Time Machine on my iMac to complete a backup, so I ordered a new 2 TB Seagate External Drive and it works great, so far."
1820,1,Zero stars,Does not work. AT ALL. WITH ANYTHING. Total and compete junk. This is so bad I'm about to just swear off Amazon.
1821,1,This product doesn't work,"When one depends on a product that will save important data, this Seagate product doesn't even work. I tried to save some of my work materials and could never retrieve them or add any more. It makes a lot of sounds like there is something wrong with it and I barely used it. I had to buy something else. Pretty expensive for not being able to use it. Complete junk."
1822,1,It didn’t work on my macbook air,"In the description it says that it will work on Mac, but unfortunately I just received the item, connected to my MacBook air and it didn’t work!! So disappointed since I was going to send this to my mom, who lives in another country, in a few days! Now I don’t have enough time to replace it with another type of hard drive"
1823,5,Useable within a few minutes.,"I am so glad it this is easy to plug and play with external Hard Drives. When you plug it in, the Xbox will ask if you want to format it or just use it for media."
1824,5,So far so good!,Doing what it is supposed to on a desktop computer USB port. I run Steam and games from it and it's all right.
1825,3,Weak connector socket,The drive itself is OK but I use mine as a portable backup that I can store off site.Plugging and unplugging the cord about 80 times is enough to make the connection intermittent.This is the third one of these that did the same thing.Will not by Seagate again.
1826,5,Money Well Spent!,"Working great so far, it feels really good having your data backed up and secured. You feel so much safer that you have a full backup of your data."
1827,4,Easy of use,"Data Transfer was rapid, smooth and easy."
1828,1,don’t waste your money if you need accurate space,I bought the 5tb and it reads as 4.5tb. Missing 500gb is a lot.
1829,5,holds up great,"I purchased this several years ago, when my very old Mac (2012), started slowing down. I transferred all videos and pictures onto this and have no problem easily retrieving info from it."
1830,5,Super Recomendado,Mi hijo pudo guardar todos sus juegos del xbox. Fue muy útil
1831,5,No issues with product or seller,"I use this product to expand the number of games I can access on my PS4, and it works fairly well.Storage capacity not compromised and it always boots up fairly quickly"
1832,1,The corrupt storage,The storage kept getting corrupted and had problems since day one. Would not recommend
1833,5,Compatible with mac,"I plugged it into my MacBook and it automatically entered into a prompt asking if I wanted to back up everything on the computer. I clicked yes, and went to Outback Steakhouse to get some loaded fries. When I got back it was already complete (I wasn’t gone too long). I double checked to make sure that it copied everything over from my computer and it literally copy and pasted my entire system onto the device. This isn’t a fake 5 star review. I plugged it in, it backed my computer, and it was pain free… if that doesn’t float your 5 star boat I don’t know what will."
1834,1,Broke,Broke after 3 months of use
1835,5,comes with adapter,"Works great, i bought an adapter not knowing it comes with one. just an fyi"
1836,1,Seagate external hard drive,"I bought this portable drive thinking my photos and documents were stored in a safe place.... wrong, it turns out that after changing the portable drive to another computer the drive was not recognized and did not work.I lost all my documents stored on that device, I contacted the company that distributes them STX Seagate.com and their answer was that I have to contact Amazon for a solution or a replacement because the code number on the divise didn't match the code number they had,.Hahaha they offer frustration free, that's not true! so if you are going to buy this product I recommend you thinking twice before you lose your photos and folderssorry but I do not recommend it!"
1837,5,Double Your Workspace,"Or less, I dunno.Depends on the drives you have on the rig's base.For me it doubled the base area, which already doubled my other external area."
1838,5,It works but watcch out,This product is good for regular old gen games but do not try to use it for next gen games because it will keep having the move the games because they can't run from the external.
1839,1,No cord,"I don't know how it works because it didn't include a cord, very disappointed"
1840,5,worth it,it is worth buying a good product
1841,5,"Have to reformat for MAC, but otherwise worked fine.",Worked fine after I had to reformat foe a Mac
1842,5,GREAT PRODUCT,Product works as advertised.
1843,4,Used for PS5,So far so good. Easy setup on the PS5 and is working well. Time will tell.
1844,1,"no estoy satisfecha con la compra, ya que no funciona",EL PRODUCTO SOLO FUNCIONO1 MES Y JUSTO DESPUES DEL VENCIMIENTO DE DEVOLUCION YA NO FUNCIONA. NO ME PARECE JUSTO PAGAR TANTO PARA QUE EL PRODUCTO NO FUNCIONE.ME LO PUEDEN CAMBIAR? PORQUE NO ESTOY NADA SATISFECHA CON ESTA COMPRA
1845,1,Agonizingly SLOW.2 hours to do ~250GB backup.,"Not much else to say other than it is the slowest disk drive I've ever seen.This is the ""floppy disk"" of the 21st century.Learning for me:If there is no mention of read/write speeds in description, stay away from it!"
1846,1,TERRIBLE Company,This device worked for a total of 4 1/2 months and died. The company wants to charge me to ship it back to them and then they will replace the device. Do NOT buy Seagate products if you don't want to spend a lot of money for crap products that they don't stand behind. The company is HORRIBLE.
1847,5,So many...,What's not to love? I have several of these for my laptop and consoles. Great price and easy to use. Highly recommend
1848,5,Fast drive and easy to set-up,I bought this portable drive to keep photos and other important data.It downloaded my tons of photos very quickly from my 9 yr old computer qnd other things I didn't want to transfer to new computer.
1849,5,Needed to download pictures and YT videos. Plenty of storage for the price.,"YT video, photos"
1850,5,As expected - good value,"Worked as expected. Was a good value at the time, but memory prices and capacities have changed a lot since I bought this."
1851,5,Reliable Storage,"Very essy from out of the box to using as storage. Can’t speak to longevity yet, but expecting it to be good."
1852,5,Great product worked perfectly for what I needed,Great product to store videos and pictures very easily. Would for sure recommend
1853,4,If only it had a usb c cable...,It is fast but I wish it came with a usb c cable.
1854,5,The amount of storage in such a small device,the device is used to store videos to keep my desk top uncluttered.
1855,4,Good for a while,Lasted a year and a half then started to break down my whole xbox couldn’t even load games or ply any my xbox would turn off on its own because of it
1856,5,"Great cold storage drive, very good value","This is a great value for your dollar if you just need some cheap storage. I got one to back up the files on my desktop and to keep them safe in external storage. These are great for cold storage, meaning you won't need to access the files a lot. If you're editing, get a 7200rpm drive or an SSD. The speed on this drive will not be enough for video editing or photo editing. Very reasonable cost and plug and play usage makes it easy to use, though!"
1857,1,Stopped working after 2 months.,Stopped working after 2 months.
1858,5,Perfect,It's the right size to store all my games. Makes it easy to transfer games between my PS4 and PS5.
1859,3,"Mac users, be aware--this drive cannot be formatted APFS nor partitioned!!!","I am a Mac user (MBP,OS Monterey) who bought this 2tB drive with the intention of partitioning it and using one partition as a backup boot drive, the other for storage backup.Turns out this drive cannot be partitioned and cannot be formatted APFS using Disk Utility, thus making it useless as a backup boot drive for the current Mac OS.I have kept it for storage backups, but I would not have purchased it had I known the above!"
1860,4,"Great product, but...","Appeared to be advertised that this could be used to backup pics off a phone with. It was not. It required that they be air-dropped to a MacBook, and then transfered againto the HD. Normally no big deal. But it has been a big deal since the photos number in the thousands!"
1861,5,easy as pie,Got this for my iMac. Plugged it in. Pointed the time machine at the drive. Walked away. Easy peasy
1862,2,"I thought it was good for a minute, then pooped out after a month.","I bought this storage for my XBOX Series S, and at first it was working great. I had no problem up until one night where it started sounding like a quiet car honking repeatedly. When I turned on my XBOX, the storage wasn’t connecting, and my games weren’t displaying. I watched countless YouTube videos and read dozens of comments basically saying it was fried. Ridiculous. Don’t buy this, folks. Waste time and money."
1863,5,15,Good lots of memory space
1864,5,So Far So Good. Works Great,Had it a few months now. It worked great out of the box and has shown no issues to date. I don't bring it a lot of places and it mostly stays on a shelf out of the reach of children. Might get another one. Good product!
1865,1,Crashed,As soon as I loaded my last file it crashed and my laptop was no longer able to detect it. I have irreplaceable photos and files stuck on here.Do not buy
1866,5,Easy to install/use,For all the rented games
1867,5,Need more disc space?,"I use a couple of cameras attached to my aircraft and the cameras create very large video files.I was running out of hard drive space on my desktop PC, so I added the Seagate drive.They are available in different capacities but I got one with 4TB of capacity.It plugs into any USB port and configures itself in seconds.No more storage issues for me and files transfer as fast as whatever USB port you plug in to.Fantastic product!"
1868,1,Recieved Refurbished,No official Seagate packing exactly as a refurbished product would be
1869,2,It stopped working,Bought this as an Xmas present for my son for his PS4. 5 months later he is telling me it no longer works.
1870,5,Perfect as described,Plug and play. Works with no issues.
1871,5,Works great with my Tablo,I love how easy it was to set it up with my Tablo
1872,1,Stopped working,I purchased this hard drive to backup files for work. It just crashed on me & I am currently on the phone trying about to be charged thousands of dollars to get data recovery on something I haven't even had for 6 months. DO NOT PURCHASE. Its cheap & faulty. Horrible quality and very sensitive. I did not drop it anywhere or damage it in any way. It just sat on my desk. Should get a refund what a waste of money not to mention all the files that are lost.
1873,5,Works with Xbox one,"I use a paper towel as a shock absorber. Maybe a cut portion of mousepad would be better. Still reads well. I have had it not read maybe twice before, but it really hasn’t been an issue."
1874,1,Not Compatible with a Mac,This hard drive is NOT compatible with a mac. The cord won't even fit. Don't purchase if you have a Macbook Air.
1875,1,stopped working,it stopped working on my xbox after like a day
1876,5,Excellent,Excellent
1877,5,DOES NOT WORK FOR PS5,DOES NOT WORK FOR PS5 WHOEVER ON HERE SAID IT DOES NEEDS TO SEEK MENTAL HELP ASAP DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ITEM
1878,4,its not fully 1GB,came with only 934 GB idk where the other 66went
1879,1,It broken after a year,I bought this item 2 times and it broke after a year and I lost all my pictures and progets. I will never buy this brand again.
1880,5,No problems,"I use this as a time machine backup drive for my Mac. The drive is about the size of a deck of cards and plugs into your computer using (the provided) 10 inch USB cable. It works great and it has lightning fast data transfer speeds....but....WARNING - this drive is designed to use newer technology USB 3.0I have a newer mac so it works incredibly well. But when I plugged it into my video monitor, which has USB 2.0 jacks, the data transfer speed dropped tremendously. Note that it still will work, but you don't get the lightning fast speed."
1881,5,Great product,Works well
1882,1,Two defective drives,Two drives in a row were defective out of the box
1883,1,NOT FOR MACS,doesn't work w Macs - listing states that it does
1884,4,Hard drive,Works as it should
1885,1,Stopped working,This hard drive has stopped working after just a few months. We haven’t dropped it or anything.
1886,5,Great,This helped greatly with my gaming PC it gave me so much more storage for games to be downloaded! Would buy again!!!
1887,5,Wow..well made hdd,Perfect hdd for backup
1888,1,"Corrupted after only one use, will not purchase again","Selected this external drive based on a series of positive reviews. Unfortunately, after one use (loaded a total of three small video files) this device will not open, receive a corrupt message when attempting to access. Will be contacting Amazon for a refund, am definitely NOT interested in a replacement from the same company. Word to the wise: focus on the negative reviews, grin."
1889,5,All the space you need for a great price,"Love the quick speed and all the space, at a great price and high quality, all in a compact shell."
1890,5,Excellent Value,excellent drive for the $$$
1891,5,This so good,None at this need longer time using but had this brand before and work great!!
1892,1,Mac User Didn't Allow Downloads,Didn't allow downloads on my MacBook.
1893,1,Does not work on Mac,As title
1894,1,fing sucks,THIS IS THE WORST DEVICE EVER!!!!! it started making ringing noises after I bought it not too long ago and it uninstalled everything. JUST AS USELESS AS YOUR MOMMMM!!!!!!
1895,1,Nothing but trouble,"At first, the hard drive worked with my Asus computer. Then it didn't. I'd insert it into the computer, the computer would recognize it and open up windows file explorer, then randomly stop recognizing the drive existed. If I tried to transfer anything, it froze and then disconnected. Sometimes it started working again, but after transferring something, it started acting up again. I thought it was the Asus because the drive still worked on my very ancient Toshiba laptop, and then it worked on my new MSI... until today. I inserted it into the MSI and the computer didn't acknowledge it's existence. The Asus acknowledged it today, allowed me to transfer some stuff, and then started freezing up and disconnecting when I tried to do anything more. Now it's not connecting at all again... I'm really disappointed. I heard Seagate was a good, reliable brand."
1896,4,"Great Buy, just had to reformat for mack","Easy to do, here are the instructions, but not what I bought. Connect the thumb drive to your Mac. Launch Disk Utility; press Command+Space then type: disk utility. Select your thumb drive in the Disk Utility window, then click the Erase tab. In the Format list box, select ExFAT, enter a Volume Label if you want, then click Erase."
1897,1,DO NOT BUY Hard drive stopped working with little use,"I transferred all my photos to this external hard drive in July and August of 2021, right after I purchased it.The hard drive has sat on a temperature controlled shelf ever since.I plugged it in to access my photos in May of 2022 - less than a year later - and the hard drive doesn't work.It just makes a beeping noise.I've tried it on multiple devices, and it's a no go.I remember reading a few reviews on this product mixed in with the good ones warning that the hard drive wasn't any good.I wish I had listened.I lost a lot of valuable photos.Don't make my mistake!Buy a different hard drive!"
1898,1,No good if transferring movies from a DVR,I'm on my third now. When you transfer movies it will keep letting you transfer but after a point you can't find the latest you transfered but they are there you just can't see icon/thumbnail for the movie. When you start deleting movie the missing ones star returning to the drive. This last drive the problem occured at 18% full.
1899,5,Hard drive,I ordered the 5 tb because I have over 50 games in I have 18 already downloaded to the hard drive with a few more waiting to be downloaded over I'm happy with quick easy to install straight to the point
1900,5,External hard drive,Works as described. Had to move all my files over and now using it as a back up.
1901,5,Easy to use,Quick setup and seems to work just fine.So far about 800gb and loaded and no complaints.
1902,5,Good Portable Disk,"This is my second Seagate Portable disk, both of them are excellent, no issues at all."
1903,3,Be sure to format.No power button.,"Would be great if it had a power button!Even though it’s cross platform, be sure to format before use.I didn’t before use and it had a problem mounting.Am using Mac."
1904,5,works great for PS4,"needed more room for my son's PS4 and plug it in, it formatted it and work fine as an storage extension."
1905,5,Lightweight 2T storage,It is small and light weight.I learned how to configure it using on youtube.
1906,1,Useless,Would not reccomend
1907,5,just like the description,its just as the description says :)
1908,5,Works as advertised.,Works well with my Xbox. Have for a long time now and no issues.
1909,4,Good not great,"I bought the 5TB hard drive because I had 4.73TB to back up, but this only holds 4.54TB.it should be called a 4.5TB hard drive.Other than that, everything seems pretty smooth.Files copy over decently fast. It's small and nice looking.It's very cool that it doesn't need a power cord."
1910,5,Great investment,This was a great investment! I my MacBook needed some cleaning up of old photo andvideo. It works out great the first time. My Mac needs an update and I haven’t had the time to backing it up again. It very user friendly. Ibarely made a dent on it and I transferred over 5K pictures!
1911,1,did not work,Never worked and unfortunately i did not use it untill after return period was closed
1912,4,It doesn't do tricks. Ask me in a year.,I'm bored. It just sits there.
1913,5,Good,Good product
1914,1,"Garbage, failed in 3 months. Listing may be something of a scam.","Drive failed in less than 3 months of use. I purchased in February and when the drive failed in May, I contacted Seagate support which told me that this drive has been out of warranty since December of 2021... I suspect very old drives may be getting sold here."
1915,5,Reliable 2TB USB Drive,Worked right out of the box. Used to move some files between my PC and laptops. A+
1916,5,Easy to use,Used for my Ps5 and love how it’s all plug and play
1917,5,Calidad y queja,Buen producto pero la ubicación de mi puerta no es esa y por poco tengo el robo de mis productos
1918,5,Easy use hard drive,Lots of storage at a great price
1919,1,Stopped working in the middle of using it,"I placed all of my backup photos, art, and files and I can't get in. My computer stopped recognizing the hard drive, though I can feel it working. :( It breaks my heart."
1920,5,Works for PS5,Needed to store some games and this did the job. Now I don't have to worry about storage capacity that most PS owners have.
1921,4,Can’t play Xbox Series X games off of it,I initially bought this drive as an external hard drive to hold my games on the Xbox Series X so that we wouldn’t have to uninstall & reinstall the games we’d like to play. Turns out you can only store many of the newer games marked “X|S” on the drive but not play them off of the drive. They’d need to be moved back to the internal SSD storage in the Xbox in order to be played. A bit disappointing but it makes sense. The drive works perfectly fine as a storage unit otherwise.
1922,3,Drive Write Speed,"This is really a nice drive with lots of storage space.That's the plus....However, I found these to be slower than a PNY 64 GB Flash Drive (3 times slower), and about 8-10 times slower than my conventional portable WD My Passport portable hard drive (using 3-1/2"" hard drive) using USB 3.0.But for the price, if you can get past the speed, with the amount of space, for the price, they are a pretty good choice for an automated backup system."
1923,5,Transfer speed.,Very satisfied.
1924,5,Great!,Nice storage for games.
1925,3,Doesn’t stay connected,"I bought this for my Xbox and every time I turn it on the games that are on this hard drive aren’t available. I want to be careful not to corrupt the device so I have to power the Xbox all the way down, unplug the hard drive, then plug it back in and turn the Xbox back on for the games to show upUpdate: I tried it with a different cord and it seems to be staying connected now. I only upped it to three stars because it was the cord that came with this hard drive that was not working, but the old cord is"
1926,5,Great for Xbox,My son loves itWas able to store all the games he’s been wanting to play
1927,5,All around pretty nice,"Ran out of space on my internal SSD so decided to buy this. So far for a couple of months, its ran fine and had no issues, and does its job well. The case part feels a little flimsy but isn't really a big deal"
1928,5,Disappointing,"5 stars but disappointing? Sounds counter-intuitive. The HD is 5-stars for performance, size and value, but can't corporate America do better in communicating to customers? HD comes with a ""Quick Start Guide"" -- which consists of showing a picture of the HD and how to connect it to the cable. In about 10 languages. Really? Then there is an .EXE file on the HD for further information. It states that Seagate HDs come unformatted. Also in about 10 languages. Only that's not true. It does come NTFS formatted. Finally, there is a year's Rescue support for free. And what's that for? Doesn't say. So you have a guide which is useless, information which is incorrect, and free support for some unexplained purpose. What's the point?"
1929,1,"Great initially, horrible over time.","I’ve had this drive for about two years and it was great for a while, then out of nowhere it stopped working and began clicking. It wouldn’t let me use any of the apps that i had on the drive and it doesn’t help that it unplugs WAY too easily."
1930,1,WARNING!! !DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS !!!!,"I may have used this product ( Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox) for 3 HOURS TOPS !!!!!! and it crapped the bed.Right in the middle of a backup it stops taking data and starts beeping.I've had this experience once before (and it just so happens it was another Seagate product) and I know it's not a good thing. Tech support is useless......,obliging but useless. Went through all their little downloadable testsonly to find out it was a ""fatal equipment failure"" I discovered through Windows diagnostics. It is still under warranty, so thankfully, hopefully, i will be able to recoup my ill spent dollars, and research my next purchase a little more. I bought this on the name Seagate and their reputation, but not again."
1931,5,Works as expected,I was impressed with how easy it was to use. Had a spare SSD drive from an older computer. Installedthe drive in the case and then installed the case in an open 3.5 slot. Boot up was flawless - the PC saw the newly added drive with no problem.
1932,5,Great size for what it stores,Coming off the cloud to a more secure and less costly storage that this provides.
1933,5,Works with XBOX SERIES S,"My boyfriend bought this for his Xbox series S, and it worked perfect. No issues at all, and it was cheaper than other hard drives. So it’s a win."
1934,5,Great product,Great product.No trouble connecting to laptop or PlayStation.
1935,4,It’s easy to setup,I love how it’s easy to use and so portable all in all very good item
1936,5,Durable,"Although not a verified purchase, bought 2 from costco, they are durable. I dropped mine like 3+ feet and thought I broke it, but it still works. Though I do not recommend dropping to test it."
1937,5,Useful,This is beneficial to me for general storage and for backup use.
1938,5,Great hard drive so far….,I purchased this hard drive for my Xbox series X and so far it’s working great! I’m very happy with it.
1939,4,First timer,Superfast using Usb-c cable.
1940,5,Fast Downloading,"Small, portable, and very quick to download onto this back-up drive.Happy with this purchase.Good value for the $$."
1941,5,Works great!,Works great for my ps4. I can finally download more games!
1942,5,Works like it's supposed to.,"Plug and play.Copied all picture folders over with a ctrl Cctrl V.Took 35 min for 22,000 files.Seems easy!"
1943,5,Great backup device.,Bought this to use as a super backup for my smaller individual backups. Huge storage for a compact size. No idea about tech support as it worked great.
1944,1,NOT compatible with Mac,Description is not correct.This is the STGX5000400 which is compatible with PlayStations and Windows. It is not compatible with MacOS.If you are looking for a MacOS compatible search for STHP5000400.
1945,1,Dont buy. Stopped working,"Do not buy this product, mine stopped working after only a few months after purchasing. Such a huge waste of my time and money to purchase a product that only operates as intended for an embarrassingly limited amount of time."
1946,5,Works great.,Product was a true plug and play. Works great.
1947,5,Great addition to my ageing TimeCapsule,"So far so good! Plugged into my 500GB TimeCapsule and no issues yet. Cheap way to add storage (although Solid State drive would have been the better choice, but $$$$)"
1948,1,Stops working at the end of the semester,It started beeping and would not be detected after roughly two months of use. This happened at the worst timing possible in the last weekend of a semester when I had projects saved on the hard drive that I could not access.
1949,5,Price is right,Small portable drive used for time machine on iMac. Won’t know about reliability for a while.
1950,3,good but stopped working,stopped connecting after a little more than a year
1951,5,Recommended,Great capacity rugged
1952,5,Seagate 2TB Backup,I ended up downloading the Wizard App. Super Easy!
1953,4,Easy to setup,Perfect for my needs
1954,5,Great add on,Great product. Easily used. Item as described. Fast shipping
1955,1,Under absolutely no circumstances should you buy this,"This device is absolute garbage. Right out of the box, the device immediately caused problems with my PC. The PC would run totally fine, the moment the hard drive was plugged in the PC would run so painfully slow and glitch out. The second the hard drive was disconnected, the PC performed as normal. I read several articles in how to fix this, none of them worked and while I was angry, atleast I had storage. Now, the thing refuses to work at all and I've lost hundreds of gigs of data. I was watching a video file when it all the sudden stopped working, then none of the files would load, now it won't even be recognized by any device I own. The hard drive will light up and then beep several times, I assume indicating that the device is corrupted. Easily the worst piece of tech I have ever purchased."
1956,3,"decent backup drive, but got slow","5tb model: Using this as a backup drive I was originally getting write speeds of around 120mbps tops over usb 3. Feels solidly built, cable is secure, a little thicker than I expected, it's closer to a half inch and thicker than a passport drive. After about a year for some reason it is only writing at about 30mbps. The wd black gaming 5tb external drive I have is writing at about 5x the speed and cost the same."
1957,3,Discrepancy 3.6 T instead of 4T bytes.,The product was ok and is working fine. The only thing isupsettingme is that I bought an 4T hard disk and my computer show that in reality is only 4.6 T bytes. WHY ?
1958,5,It works,It does what it needs to do
1959,5,Excelente,Fusiona muy bien
1960,4,"Good so far, but rather loud.","I need to find a sound dampener. - Also, it seems strange that my 8tb WD (red drive) seems to read faster, even though it's only 5400rpm. This Seagate drive being 7200rpm, should read faster than that, especially with 4tb's remaining."
1961,4,Confused!,Just confused as to why it wasn't a full 2tb I got 1.81
1962,4,"Hard to get working, had to format to exFAT using Mac","Out of the box (formatted with NTFS), it was in a semi-working state where I could copy some files to it before it would slow down to less than 3MB/s then freeze up (tried on Ubuntu leaving it transferring overnight and it never finished and Windows 10 as well). Reformatting to NTFS didn't fix anything.The fix was to format it to exFAT. I did this using Disk Utility on an Apple computer."
1963,1,Very slow write speed,I am did appointed with this drive. I have a 1TB Seagate HDD that works fine but this drive was awful. At times the write speed dropped to less than 20kb/sec. I can't tie up my computer for days waiting for abackup to complete. I should have read the other 1 star reviews before buying. I'm going to return this as it's useless for me.
1964,5,Portability !!,Ideal storage device
1965,5,RELIABLE STORAGE,"For years I have depended on Seagate hard drives to store my digital files, movie, music, and more. Whilst these Hard Drives need an upgrade in terms of speed and I would like to see SSD availability in higher capacities, these drives have been my go-to storage for more than 2 decades. Every Western Digital drive I have ever owned has failed - Seagate has always worked! These are the ones to get if you're serious about storing your data."
1966,4,The Replacement,My Time Machine HD went bad - Replaced it with this one - Setup was easy and away it went.
1967,5,Love it,"We love this product. My son can put all his games on it, so that he can have space on his computer. We are very happy with it."
1968,4,Doesn't like my USB 3 Ports,"This drive works fine when plugged into my USB 2.0 ports on the back of my computer, but when plugged into the USB 3.0 ports on the front of my PC, it causes the PC to crash and reboot in a loop. While I suppose it could be the ports, I've never had an issue with any other USB 3.0 device in those ports.I just leave it plugged into the back of my PC, since it is used for backup, primarily."
1969,1,Expect it to break soon,"I did a back up once around the time i bought this thing (July 8, 2021).Haven't touched it since.Til today.Now it can't write new data to the disk.Not happy about it."
1970,4,Size,"So far I like it, never needed Tech Support"
1971,5,Was easy to install on my grandsons playstation 4 and to move games over..,"Easy to hook up. Small and portable.No problems with it , would buy it again ."
1972,5,Easy to use,I’m not a techy but find this user friendly. No glitches
1973,4,False advertising!,Says it's 4 tb but really it's 3.6 tb!
1974,5,Very good,"Very good choice if you want a cheap alternative to a hard drive that you would put into your device, my only complaint is it unplugs really easily but I put it in a spot where nothing can mess with it so it doesn't unplug"
1975,4,Decent,My husband ordered this for his ps4 and he says it has really good storage and can hold a lot. It’s easily portable and nice to have
1976,4,Good 2TB External but….,"Great external 2TB of storage but when it comes to using for Xbox or PS5 it’s not. It will store and hold the downloaded games but will not play from them. You’ll have to download your games again to the internal storage of your game console because it’s not a fast enough connection to play directly from the hard drive. But if your looking to just use for storage, it’s a good buy for the price."
1977,5,I like it,"Does what it needs to. A lot of space, no problems with it so far. Used it for my Xbox."
1978,4,Works until it disconnects.,"I have this plugged into my Xbox and after about a month or 2 it will disconnect and I have to unplug and plug it in again. Not sure why this is happening. Other than that, it works great."
1979,2,"Worked fine, until it didn’t.","I bought this drive a little over a year ago to use as video storage for homemade movies. When I first got the drive, no problems were apparent. Great write times, great read times, and worked very well. After about six months it started to slow down quite a bit. After around a year it started to randomly stop and become extremely slow. “Device failed due to hardware error” was the most common message I would see. A few days ago the drive completely gave up, and if I plug it into any computer it will freeze the whole system and I have to pull the plug from the back. I had around 6tb of videos on it. Luckily I had a backup drive as well as backblaze to which I will hopefully use to recover the data, but I won’t be buying this again."
1980,5,Complacido,Hasta ahora ha estado funcionando muy bien.Llegó rápido y en perfectas comdiciones.
1981,5,Does what’s supposed to do and works with the PS5,Just plug it in and you’re done
1982,1,THIS SUCKS! DO NOT BUY!,This thing crapped out on me and was not even letting me access it
1983,5,Works right out of the box,this hard drive works well right out of the box.No formatting needed.Stores all of our videos and photos is compact and easily transported.Lightweight and efficient!
1984,1,NOT 18TB,Bought this for more storage space was disappointed that ordered a 18 TB and package says 18 TB but once hooked up is really a 16TB.
1985,5,Storage,"Absolutely love it, was only able to hold 2 games before now I can download the whole game store if I wanted to. 10 out of 10 everything runs smooth my games transferred really quick cod cold war is a 200+ gig game transferred in 20 minutes, super quick. Doesn't take up much space I highly recommend if you need storage"
1986,1,Does not work,"After 2 back to back items not working, I switched to another brand. First said that the start here was not installed properly. The second one missing it entirely. Not worth the aggravation."
1987,5,Fit the need,Great size and price. This is my second one.
1988,5,Perfect size and storage capacity,This is the second one I have purchased. It has a lot of space and is easy to use and take places.
1989,5,Compact but lots of storage,I purchased this HD in order to free up my iCloud and I still have plenty of space for more!!Its also nice to store valuable information and unplug from the computer so it can not be accessed
1990,5,Compact plug-in ready to go,"Affordable, reliable and surprisingly fast on USB 3. It's predecessor (unnamed) was slower and cranky and had to be redirected to other tasks such as backup to the backup. I figured a new backup would take about 24 hours; the Seagate did it in less than 6 hours (or even less as I went to bed)."
1991,5,Love it so much I have 2,"Scanning in photos from my whole family, this is great"
1992,5,Works fine.,Just what I wanted.Works good.
1993,2,This drive is NOISY.,"This drive makes a lot of noise. I'm using it as a Time Machine backup drive. However, I'm going to purchase something else for this as this drive is driving me crazy."
1994,5,Storage,Serves my purpose
1995,5,Excelente,Excelente
1996,5,Great For Mac Gaming,I use this and a usb adapter on my MacBook Pro and it works perfectly! A bit noisy but that’s all the cons really.
1997,1,Not for my ps5,I see some reviews is for ps5 not for myMy ps5 support until 8tb my coming whit 8.1tb and doesn’t work for me
1998,1,There are no directions and web site for Seagate is not helpful.,I have spent hours and still unsuccessful in saving files to this external drive.so frustrated
1999,1,Garbage. Stopped working a month after the 1 year warranty.,"This was the first Seagate HD that I have every purchased. I bought this HD for extra space on my PS4. There is a lot of reading/writing that happens when playing saved games off this thing, but if it can only handle 13 months of data transfer then it is useless and a waste of money. this will be the last time I waste my money on a Seagate garbage!"
2000,5,EXCELENTE,cumple con todo y a un excelente precio!
2001,1,Nonfuncitonal,Storage cannot be accessed from my computer. Selecting it in device management crashes PC. Not a functional item - look elsewhere.
2002,5,"Easy to use.,",Light and easy to use
2003,5,Pretty nice hard drive,It works with the Xbox serious s and it can store a lot of games and it’s easy to use and I transfer all my games to this hard drive and works great
2004,5,Worked perfectly for Xbox one,Easy to set up and works perfectly for Xbox one
2005,5,Good price,Love it
2006,1,WARNING: DOES NOT WORK FOR MACBOOK PRO!!,This does not have software for mac. It has an Exe file that needs Windows. They lie. they lie. Return ASAP.
2007,5,Purchased two,My two sons are avid gamers and had so many downloaded games on their XBox & XBoxOne. These are perfect for storage and the games downloaded very fast. Nice solution if you’re in to gaming and don’t want to delete what you’ve paid for.
2008,5,Works with Xbox one,"Worked with my Xbox one to store extra games , no issues or problems, just a long wait to sync at first but after that you are good to go!"
2009,4,"If they tweak there product a little bit, it would be great",I disliked that on the Xbox you have to unplug and plug it back in to read games properly. It happens quite often
2010,1,Not lasting,So I bought this for my Xbox series s and it was great .... well for the short time it last is only lasted 6 months before it broke internal and its not like I wasn't taking care of it so please don't buy.
2011,5,It's very efficient,I really like the speed.
2012,5,Great storage,"With many years of documents and such, I now have 3 of these and probably will get more. Great value."
2013,5,It's still working 6 months later,"The jury is still out on longevity. So far, it's working as intended, and is easy enough to access on my pc."
2014,1,Just Stopped working yesterday sitting on my desk!!!,That it stopped working!!!!
2015,5,Noice,"Does its job, havent had problems with it"
2016,5,Exactly what I was looking for.,Great item
2017,4,"It's a box, with a disc, that records things.It is what it is.",It is what it is.It does what it's supposed to do.Functional.Unremarkable.Good price.
2018,5,Ext usbdesk top hard drive,Good deal low cost per mega fast quiet like the usb3 ports in the front can always use more ports
2019,5,thank you,thanks. as advertised
2020,1,Can’t handle large file numbers,After loading the drive with thousands of small files the drive slows down and then finally disconnects. I have tried more than one of this model and had the same problem. I was able to find another brand that could handle the large number of files. This drive would probably be okay if backing up large size files but I can’t understand why it gets confused when loading it with hundreds of folders and thousands of files
2021,1,Not worth it,"I've had it for a couple months and it was working great, now it's done nothing but completely mess up my Playstation, if I put it in rest mode and the extended hard drive is plugged in, it will not turn on. When I plug it in it just keeps saying I need to restore it, I restore it, and then it just magically disappears again, and forces my Playstation to actually turn off and blue screen me. I can't get in contact with the seller to try and fix this issue."
2022,4,Portable,Portable and overall convenient
2023,5,Works great for my PS5,It is totally worth it as I have invested this one for my PS5. It’s not fast transfer game data as my PS5 console require to play the game internally. This one I use it as a “bridge” to go back & forth to play the PS5 game from my external HDD. It is considerably cheaper option for me as SSD is still very expensive.
2024,5,Almost returned it,When I got this for my boyfriend it said it was not compatible with his PS4. So he did the EFat thing. After he put his game in. It gave an option to use as extended storage which is what you want to see. I'm not sure if it took time to recognize it or what but it works. He couldn't be happier.
2025,5,As expected,Product delivered timely and works as indicated.
2026,5,Good for Mac,I have a Macbook Pro and I am able to use it easily after setting the hard drive for the Mac. I tried what they suggest on their website but didn't work. I suggest you watch 'Seagate External Hard Drive How to Set Up on Mac 2021' on Youtube.
2027,1,Died after 4TBW,"This drive started giving me the ""click of death"" and died after having written just about 4TB. So I never even got a chance to fill it up before it croaked. Good thing it was a backup drive and I didn't have anything unique on it!"
2028,3,Nice but noisy,Reliable so far but clunky in operation
2029,1,Stopped working 6 months later,"Stopped working 6 months later, barely recovered the files from it. It's my second one from that brand to break, won't buy again"
2030,5,Works great for PS5,Works great for PS5
2031,5,Life saver for my ps4.,"Bought this for my ps4 and it works great, you get 1.8 TB of space. Do NOT put this on your console because it will overheat it and ruin it. It is also very small which is great for portability."
2032,3,False Advertising,"Firstly, package came exactly when it was supposed to and is as light and portable as it advertised. However, it came with 1.81TB versus the 2TB we paid for. We looked into it and found there was something already on the hard drive and even with removing the items it didn’t not add up to 2TB. It’s plenty of space otherwise but I paid $66 for 2TB."
2033,5,150 MB/s write speeds! Totally worth it.,"My previous drive topped out at around 40 MB/s which I thought was pretty fast, but just started an image backup and this thing was ranging between 60 MB/s all the way up to 150 MB/s. About to place an order for a second one!"
2034,1,Great with Mac not pc,"This device doesn’t show up on any pc’s only mac. Support disappointed. Also, the support is not helpful."
2035,1,Very very glitchy!,"Sad I waited so long to use it. disconnects, freezes, and malfunctions a lot."
2036,2,Buyer Beware,"I bought a few variations of this product as there are two PS5s in my home that needed the extended storage. One, purchased in February still works. The other, purchased about a year ago...well... keep reading. I saw a few reviews that warned of the hard drive suddenly malfunctioning and losing all of the stored data. I thought it was probably just a few malfunctioning units and took the chance on this hard drive anyway. The price was attractive and it seemed easy to use. For $99 I guess you get what you pay for. I will say, this product worked PERFECTLY in the beginning and was just what I needed. However, none of that really matters when one day you boot up your Playstation and literally EVERYTHING is wiped. The worst part is, I can't even seem to repair the it in any way after hours of googling and trial and error. Worth noting, I am very tech savvy so if there was a way to fix it...I would've found it.Now, I've just got a very expensive paperweight and have to download my entire game library again. Here's hoping I have my save files in the cloud. This is a gamer's worst nightmare. So in short, feel free to roll the dice on this harddrive... it may work perfectly for you. However, to me, the fact that it malfunctioned so early in it's life cycle and many others have had the same problem, this is simply unacceptable. If I had known, I probably wouldn't have purchased the second unit."
2037,5,Did the job,I ordered this to extend the storage on my Xbox series s game console and it did exactly what I bought it to do I've had no issues with that it starts up right away I was able to pair it and format it
2038,1,Don't trust the Company,"After downloading all my information on Hard Drive my computer said the drive wasn't properly ejected and it was still attached.My computer wouldn't recognize the drive again, so I called the company and went through all the trouble shooting with them. Nothing worked and drive started making a humming noise and the support person said that's not good we'll have to replace it. I was fine with that as long as they sent me the replacement and a return label. I asked several times if this was the case and was told yes.I never received an email saying the new drive had shipped to me. Just an email about feedback from the call I made.I contacted them through chat on the sea gate web site. He asked if I had received an email regarding a credit card authorization. I asked why would you need that. He didn't answer me. I told him I was supposed to get a replacement drive then I was supposed to send the broke one back. I was very uncomfortable about sending the broken drive back anyways because I had backed up all my info on to that drive and they boast recovering information off hard drives that are damaged. They said they'd send me a free return label but had to send broken drive back first. I have a problem with companies that change what they say in the first place so I'm just returning the drive to Amazon and getting a refund. I don't feel comfortable though because they still have the drive and everything from my computer is on that broken drive. Maybe they can or can't fix the drive, but I feel there so much fraud out there how do I know what happens with my information that can or can't be recovered on the drive I'm sending to God know who."
2039,4,Slower than an SSD drive but holds alot of data.,Great product for the price.I'm using mine to hold games.Access rates are slower than my SSD drives but not enough to take away enjoying the games.Can't beat it for the price.
2040,5,Good product,Happy so far.
2041,5,wow finally big affordable back up drives,14 tb is all you need to know...wish i could trade in about 10 old ones i have...
2042,2,"Size, backup if you want","Size, backup and storage wasn’t there as it’s expected"
2043,5,XBOX ONE X,"I bought the 16tb specifically for my XBOX ONE X..Just so there is no confusion.., YES IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE XBOX BOX ONE and I have downloaded all my games..With over two hundred games in my library the 16tb was a much have.. GREAT PURCHASE.."
2044,5,just what i needed,"used for an xbox one, awesome price and extremely easy to use!"
2045,5,Excelente,Lo recomiendo
2046,5,BUEN DISCO DURO,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
2047,5,Small and compact,Very good
2048,4,It Works,Arrived in good shape and running well.
2049,5,"Buena capacidad, velocidad y precio",Lo o utilizo para almacenar información de no mucha rotación y ha Sido muy util
2050,2,It's Loud,"I took another chance on a Seagate after one died on me and I lost EVERYTHING about 10 years ago. I like that it has disaster recovery support, fingers crossed I won't need it.Pros: It's fast, and its price point is great. Cons: the 12GB is actually only 10GB, it's LOUD as hell and has an unnerving clicking noise and desk vibrating hum when files are being transferred. I may change my rating if it proves to have any kind of longevity, but so far I'm really not all that impressed."
2051,5,Easy to use,"I am not a tech person, but this was easy to use."
2052,5,Great,Worked great for my Xbox
2053,5,I am glad I purchased,So far so good. Easy to setup and seems to not malfunction. Just started using it.
2054,5,"Pequeña, y con todo lo necesario","Muy buen tamaño, y silencioso"
2055,1,Cheap n defective overpriced,"Item was damaged upon arrival.Contacted customer support only for them to put purchase price onto a Amazon gift card. Took nearly 3 weeks to receive a refund and had to buy another hard drive from a near by vendor for half the cost on Amazon for same product.Don’t buy from this vendor. Used item, open box, and defective upon arrival. Poor packaging and difficult to work with."
2056,5,Nice durable disk,I have all my karaoke music on this disk now and it's done some travelling. ;)It's very durable and works really well.Absolutely no issues connecting it.Cord could be a LOT longer.I'm very happy with it.
2057,5,Great tiny hard drive,Great tiny hard drive
2058,1,Has 1.8 GB and does not work too well,This product is not working well
2059,1,STOPPED CONNECTING AFTER 2 MONTHS,"I got mine around February and in the middle of a game on my xbox, it just disconnected itself and I couldn't even mount it to my laptop afterwards."
2060,1,"Almost dead on arrival, and Seagate website no help at all","It seemed clear to me that this product was almost too good to be true. As any trader would tell you, if it appears that way, it probably is. Mine arrived today. Plugged it into my macbook pro, it lit up and booted. Ordinarily, that should be all that's needed. Except, this is NOT an SSD, and it may need some kind of bootup. For that, there's an exe and an app. Only the app will work on my mac, except it would not boot; my computer said it may be damaged or incomplete. I plan to return it immediately. But, you'd think that seagate's website might help. Here's the review I gave them when they asked:The very idea that I cannot contact your support at 4pm in my time zone sucks. The very idea that the bootup app for mac on my 4tb external disk will not boot (""it's broken"") sucks more. Your question answering page never heard of Start_Here_Mac.app - that speaks volumes to how Seagate thinks."
2061,1,So so so slow,I’ve been trying to export a video onto this hard drive for over three weeks now and I’m not kidding I don’t know if this was just effective but
2062,5,HDD Go Brrr,"I mean, it works. All I can really ask for with a product like this."
2063,1,Crashed after 3 weeks,"I bought the device for external backups.I only used it a couple of times over a 3 week period.The next time I tried to use it the thing was dead !!!!Its in warranty, but I can't clear my data from the unit and don't want to compromise myself by sending it back for replacement.They clearly state they are not responsible for information on old unit. I guess I will just throw it away."
2064,3,10tb Seagate is noisy.,"10tb Seagate is noisy. 2022. came in 4 hours.Formatted it for a imac.great price at 221, but was not expecting to hear it buzz, or expect to be able to feel my desk vibrate when the heads move.I imagine the heads are massive given the storage size and multiple disks.on another note, the reviews here on Amazon seem to be for ALL harddrives.worthless."
2065,5,I like this Seagate addon memory.,The price was right so I grab this deal up for external memory.
2066,5,Works great love it!,Worked great just made the ps4 games lag
2067,5,Great price and item!,I liked the size of this external hard drive. I looked through Amazon quite a bit before purchasing and the price was fair and competitive for having 2TB of memory. My son uploads a lot of his video game videos into it to save room on his PC and he’s never had any issues with it.
2068,5,Works great with the ps4,This external storage device works awesome with my ps4 and was extremely easy to install.
2069,4,"Lightweight, great storage","I'm using this as a backup for high quality photos. It's a great portable storage option that I keep in my briefcase. Very lightweight.The only thing I wish it did was be able to be used for both a mac and a PC. It seems like I had to choose 1 or the other, which is annoying because I have a Mac at home, and a PC at work..."
2070,5,Good investment,With this I no longer need to delete games off my console to free up some space money well spent
2071,3,Great 12TB drive..... with a big caveat,"TL;DR - Buy this drive to use as a backup you use occasionally to store large files. Look elsewhere if you want a drive to use daily.To give context, I bought this drive for 2 purposes1. To transfer everything from my current PC to my new build2. To act as a backup and mass storage drive going forwardThat being said, during the process of transferring all of my files to this drive, there were many large files, and thousands of small ones (under 10 mb). I bought this drive because of the usb 3.0 thinking that transferring everything would be quick and painless due to the advertised ""high write speeds""Where this drive shines is transferring very large files. The write speeds sat around 120-160 mb per second. BUUUUUUTTTT.... When I started transferring smaller files, the write speeds crawled all the way down to kilobytes per second.I transferred a folder with 187 GB worth of video files averaging about 4 GB per file. The entire transfer process took 25 minutes and change. Very impressive.I then transferred a 7 GB folder of smaller files (license files, microsoft office documents, etc. (kilobytes per file)). The transfer took 40 minutes.........The transfer speed directly correlated to the size of the files being transferred. If you transfer a folder with both large and small files, the write speed will fluctuate like crazy. This is normal behavior, but for some reason this drive took it to the extreme. Most external Hard Drives I have used in the past never went below 5-10mb per second EVER.This drive is a solid choice for transferring mass storage for ease of mind. But with other reviews stating this drives short life span, I'll have to wait and see how mine lasts in the long run. That combined with the crawling speed for batches of small files, leaves me on the fence on how I feel about this thing.One last gripe, it would have been nice to have a power button/switch for the drive. I like to turn off/unplug my externals if I'm not actively using it to lengthen the drive's lifespan. Not a deal breaker by any means, but unplugging the power cable after every use gets old."
2072,2,Not as Mac friendly as described,Much harder to connect to Mac than described. It was difficult to transfer data.
2073,1,it done broke.,It kept disconnecting for no reason. finally it broke completely after just a couple months.p.s. Will NOT buy this again.
2074,3,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"It is not 1TB, it is 931GB and for some reason there is 131MB after formatting the drive."
2075,5,2Tb Hard Drive,This hard drive works amazingly on my sons PS4. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a hard drive for their PS4.
2076,5,"Boy, was he surprised!","I bought this for my son.He had been hinting about wanting one, so I got him one for Easter.He loves it.He was able to clear up a lot of space on his computer by moving what was on there to the external hard drive."
2077,1,garbage,Worked for less than one year. And crashed with all my clients data on it. Im giving it one star because zero isnt an option
2078,2,Corrupt after 3 months of use,"Luckily I have 2 forms of backup, but this drive lost my files only 3 months in. I have another one of these drives that I used for the last year without issue, but after this experience I will never purchase again."
2079,5,It Just works,"As a wise man one said, “and all this just works”"
2080,1,DOES NOT WORK on Xbox Series S,"I bought this hoping I would gain 2TB for gaming in my Xbox Series S Console, but was VERY disappointed when plugging it in and indicating the transfer rate is too slow.DO NOT BUY FOR THE XBOX SERIES S consoles as you will be very disappointed."
2081,5,Never enough space.,This hard-drive works great. Not a single problem.
2082,5,Works perfectly.,"No problem with it, i use it for more ps5 storage"
2083,5,14TB review: It's suppose to be 12.7TB useable space,"If you are giving 1 star specifically for the 14TB only showing 12.7TB as useable space, then you are not very bright.This drive is great.Speeds over 200+mb/s.This is a storage drive to use for backups & storing data.If you are using everyday all day, then you are using it wrong."
2084,5,I was surprised to see how small this was,Somewhere I had a 1 TB external drive but I couldn't find it even though it was the size of a cable modem. I thought that this was a good deal for a 2 TB external drive. I used it once and it is so small that I am going to have to put a sticker on it so that I can distinguish it from every other small black box that is in my office.
2085,1,Meh,Only lasted 3 months. Was going to be too much of a hassle to go through the warranty process.
2086,5,Just got it and it says 10tb instead of 12tb. Not happy at all.,"Not happy at all. It says 12 TB on the box but once I connected to my pc, it shows 10TB. NOT HAPPY AT ALL...."
2087,5,Very good,Awesome stuff made everything better
2088,5,Works good,Works good
2089,5,So far so good.Pretty good backup software.,So far so good.Good backup software.
2090,1,NO WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS IN ENGLISH,NO written instructions in English
2091,5,Indispensable para no perder información,
2092,5,"Great drive, excellent value","I tried a cheap unknown brand external drive to backup my data. At the first use it failed. I decided it wasn't worth the extra few dollars I saved and went with is Western Digital drive (still a great value.) I had to buy an add on USB 3.0 port because my computer was USB 2.0 only. Even with the added cost of the USB 3.0 port, the speed of the port and the drive made it totally worth the cost. The drive worked flawlessly and is inexpensive enough to be disconnected and stored off-site. If you value data integrity but still want a good value, I recommend this drive."
2093,5,Great hard drive!,I have used a lot of hard drives of different brands and Seagate is by far the best. I have six of these little drives now and haven't had a problem out of any of them.
2094,5,Great,"I love it!Formatting was easy.I moved my bigger games to this external hard drive.When moving or downloading using this hard drive, don’t even touch it!Even moving it slightly will mess up your download, then you will have to re-download.If I ever needed an external hard drive with anything I will buy this in a heartbeat!!The price was good and reasonable, I didn’t want to buy something too expensive but not inexpensive."
2095,5,Works on xbox series S,I personally bought it to be used on a Xbox series s. It works to store games to avoid having to delete and download constantly.
2096,5,Vulnerable to malware,"I noticed that there were ""photo.scr"" files all over my Seagate drive, and a little research revealed that these drives have been vulnerable to malware for years when used as a network storage device. Look up Seagate and photo.scr before purchasing to see for yourself, won't ever buy a Seagate drive again as this is a design flaw they've refused to address since 2015 at least."
2097,1,Unrecognized,Have it as a gift 2 months ago. It stopped working 3 days after hooking it up. Tech support still hasn't gotten back with her
2098,1,Failed after one year,Failed precisely one week after warranty expired. Wonderful customer experience.
2099,3,"Next time, I will buy some other hard drive that presents fewer problems.","This is the fourth Seagate hard drive that I have bought. There was a time when one could buy a Seagate external hard drive that was formatted for a Mac computer. No more. Their hard drives can only be purchased formatted for PC. If one wants to use this hard drive with a Mac, one must re-format.So if one accesses the Seagate website, the directions seem simple enough until one reaches the stage of the actual formatting. When one clicks Erase, nothing happens. I tried several times and had my wife try it. There is a Chat Room one can ask for help, but it could not be accessed either. I was finally able to re-format the hard drive by taking it to an Apple repair facility. Next time, I will buy some other hard drive that presents fewer problems."
2100,5,Xbox Games storage.,"I use this to store Xbox games, I can notice no difference when playing a game on this hard drive vs. playing a game downloaded on the console."
2101,5,Great price and works for Playstation,"This was cheaper than the licensed harddrive, and works the same. I had to reformat in the PS5 after accidentally Formatting for and External in the PS4. You can't ""go back"" after that so used the PS5 to reformat and i was able to finally get all my saves off the PS4 and PS3 to the PS5! 10/10 would recommend over the more expensive licensed hardrive of the SAME type and brand!"
2102,5,Paid less for much more,"I got much more than what I expected, coming with authentic subscriptions to products such as Adobe Photoshop and others. The memory space is great and actually having technological help in case files go missing is such a bonus. I definitely made a great investment"
2103,3,Not sure about newer MacBooks,Well says it works for Mac but I cannot get it to work with my 2020 MacBook Air. Followed the directions downloaded the software and did updates and nothing. Might be me but I can’t get it to work.
2104,2,Broke 20 days after the 1 year period.,"I bought this drive 13 months ago and today - boom - completely corrupted.I will obviously try and repair it but first I need to buy ANOTHER drive to make sure I maintain a back up of this.I find it odd that it broke 20 days after the 1 year ""recovery"" period."
2105,5,Worth the purchase!!,Great product! This is my 2nd purchase of this 2TB external hard drive. Purchased this one for my son for his ps4 after purchasing one for my husband. I would definitely recommend.
2106,5,Great,Great deal!
2107,1,DO NOT BUY,"this is not a reliable product. I have important data, worth of many months, suddey it beeping and stopped recognizing.DO NOT BUY"
2108,4,Funciona Bien,Funciona Bien
2109,1,Completely stopped working just after return window closed,"It worked just fine at first, like a typical plug and play drive.I offloaded some files that were filling up my computer, and then used it a few times to access them.Then it subsequently died after a short number of months.Power flows to it, and the light blinks as if it's starting up, but then the light goes to steady on (which it shouldn't normally do), and my computer doesn't recognize it as a drive.Would have been money ahead just to select a bunch of moderately important files and immediately delete them."
2110,5,Good for general storage and personal needs.,Works well for storing photo's and videos !
2111,5,Just as advertised,Bought it for security camera usage and so far has worked perfectly. No hassle installation and no problems.
2112,5,Good price,"Great price for what you get. 2 TB for approximately $50 is fantastic. Lightweight, portable and plug and play."
2113,5,As advertised,"compact, fast. great purchase."
2114,4,Just plain works,"Bought for external storage for a PS 5 so it's portability is a non issue for me,and it works flawlessly. No stutter in game and huge capacity can hold my entire PS 4 library with some room to back up PS 5 games so I can just move them to internal storage instead of re downloading"
2115,1,2tb Not compatible with Mac,The description says that it is for Mac but that is a lie. Mine (2 TB) just came in and it says it's only compatible with windows...
2116,1,Does not work with a Mac,Only works with windows. Does not work with Mac.
2117,3,Do not buy this. They are straight up lying,"18TB hard drive written on the box. 18TB Hard drive written on the Amazon Information.16.2TB is available on the drive.when you buy a drive AT MOST you lose a gig for the hard drive 'software'but TWO TERRABYTES?No. Lying. I'm so angry. I can NOT find a decent hard drive, this is frustrating.---After searching, this is the only option. The 16TB registered as 14TB, the 14 Registers as 12TBfor SOME Reason 2 TB is lost when you buy a drive... doesn't make ANY freakin sense, and I'm pissed about it but I'll keep the product because there is nothing better out there and 16 doubles my current 8.Just be aware the size lies."
2118,3,"Bought six, two failed after two years","A 1-year warranty is not nearly enough for a hard drive. So far, 2 out of 6 of these that I bought have failed."
2119,1,"Broken twice, made me lose a lot of data","The first one I bought broke after maybe several times of usage. Then Seagate replaced it with a new one. The new one lasted a bit longer. Then, just a couple of days ago, I backed up my data with this drive before re-installing my os. It happened again. My PC just can't recognize this drive. It's not a problem with drivers or cables. I tried it on other computers with other cables. The drive is just dead. Now I lost all my data I backed up with this brick. Will never use anything from Seagate again."
2120,5,good,working good
2121,5,Easy to use,Easy to use
2122,2,Don’t buy if you have a series S or X,Not sure if I happened to get a defective one or not but I have an Xbox series S and it won’t let me download newer games it says I need a faster storage device when this says it’s a USB 3.0 Otherwsie I can play older games on it which is nice I guess so it works in that aspect
2123,5,Ed T,Works as advertised
2124,1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THESE!,"Updated review... I finally got customer service to replace my drives, I have purchased 2 both defective, both replaced and the first replacement is already showing stress cracks from internal overheating! Please save your money and buy another brand. There is no durability with this product. I have babied this one because of the issues and still it is DEFECTIVE. No one has time to keep returning and moving files over and over. It's a total loss for me, maybe my review will save you!"
2125,5,Love it,Works very well. I got exactly what I wanted.I use it daily.Perfect portable easy to use. Great product.
2126,5,Good product,I use this for extra storage on computer we use as a NAS.This has held up well over the last five months and is still going strong.No issues with writing to the drive.Write speeds could be better but it's fine for what we use it for.
2127,5,Easy to use,Exactly what I needed.
2128,2,1/10,It doesnt connect to my ps4 no more and it deleted all the games
2129,1,Seagate Horrific,"Amazon has been amazing trying to help.me get ahold of Seagate! Seagate- horrific! All pictures loaded then unable to connect hard drive to any computer! Unable to access thousands of stored pictures!! Unfortunately I missed Amazon return by 1 day, however, seagate has 1 year warranty. Myself nor Amazon rep has been able to contact seagate after multiple on hold customer service calls for over 20 minutes! Seagate will replace hard drive, but not retrieve pictures unless I pay close to 1000.00!!I will definitely find a different external hard drive manufacturer!"
2130,1,Not Mac Compatible,This is not compatible with a Mac like it states. It is not plug and play at all. I am returning this. If you have a Mac just avoid this.
2131,5,Awesome little hard drive!,I was astounded by the storage space when I first plugged it up to my computer! I got it mainly to install my games from my Steam library because I was running out of space on my computer. I highly recommend this if you need storage space!
2132,5,A GOOD PRODUCT,No problem works as expected.
2133,5,Great,Great. It was perfect for what I needed it for.
2134,1,Can’t get it to program IOS.,"Won’t work with my Mac, which is not what it said in the description."
2135,5,Works great!,It works great
2136,5,Great Product,Great Product
2137,5,Works great and fast,We use it for our old Xbox1 and it has helped a ton for loading speeds.
2138,2,"Good capacity for the money, but poor transfer speed defeats the point","I am writing this review while waiting for a backup transfer to complete. I've owned half a dozen Seagate external drives and found them all to be worth the money. Unfortunately, after purchasing and using this drive to move TBs of backup data at an abysmal 20MB/s I cannot recommend it. The Seagate STEL6000100 is capable of 100+ MB transfer speeds, as is the Western Digital My Passport. Both of those drives utilize USB 3.0/3.1, which this drive supposedly supports as well. Why the transfer speed for this drive is so utterly useless I do not know, but the point still stands... those other drives work flawless and quickly out of the box, this one does not."
2139,1,Very Cheap Material,The drive itself and cable feel very cheap and it didn't even come in its original box. Once I opened it to use on Mac the startup file was damaged. Completely unless. Very disappointed with this purchase. Seems very sketchy. Will try Walmart or Best Buy.
2140,5,Awesome!,"My PlayStation now has lots of storage. My wife got it to download all her sims stuff on my console. Before she would complain that she couldn’t download new packs because there was no space but now she happily plays with no complaints, thankfully."
2141,3,I don't like Seagate anymore,"The HDD is still working but I don't know for how much time, but I had 2 internal HDD in my computer and other 4TB external drive, and all of them died after 4 months of litte use. I bought WD Hard Drives and that are working perfect. Don't buy Seagate, is a terrible brand."
2142,1,Slower than your mom on fb in traffic,Writes slow stops all the time during it
2143,5,best gift for boyfriend,"i got this for my boyfriends PS4, and he loves it. it is so usually and now he came download as many games as he wants. all you gotta do is plug it into the PS4, super easy. you can also unplug it when the PS4 is off if you are wanting to travel/take it anywhere. all you gotta do is plug it back in and you’re good!! i absolutely love this storage device!!"
2144,5,Muy bueno el Seagate de 2 TB - USB 3.0,"el disco duro funciona de maravilla, el case debería ser un poco más resistente, se siente liviano."
2145,5,Buena compra,Me funciona bien y gracias al precio que lo pude comprar más de 50 juegos descargados en mi ps4
2146,5,Great extra storage,My desktop Mac is older and lacking internal memory compared to newer iMac and this external hard drive has really helped with storing major documents and photos!
2147,1,Storage is less than 2Tb but I,What I dislike is about the capacity. The hard disk is empty but lose like 200Go it is too much. The capacity is correct.
2148,4,"Good storage, loud unit.","I’m happy with the storage space and the performance of this drive so far, but it is a loud unit! And quite beefy in size. It’s also AC powered, not powered by the port, which is inconvenient."
2149,5,Pequeño y funcional,Es fácil de cargar y buena capacidad
2150,1,Short life,Mine failed after 2 years. No rough treatment an mostly sat hooked up in the same place with only minor access to the information.
2151,1,It died on arrival.Seagate support AOL,"Arrived today.Plugged it in and it started to beep, beep.Computer found it but unable to open.Message said device was working.Still unable to open.Called Seagate waited on hold for about ten minutes.Tech answered asked a couple questions and the phone went dead.I sent it back and ordered a Western Digital same size for $2.00 less.It'll be here tomorrow."
2152,5,Works perfect take my word buy it promise you won’t regret it,Perfect for ps4
2153,4,Works great,Great storage fits all my games on it
2154,5,Great storage,Easy to install and working well!
2155,3,Large capacity for money,Lots of space for money. Drive however isn't very robust. I keep getting check drive for error warnings.
2156,1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this drive to store graphics and video that were previously stored across several 2TB drives. Once everything had been moved and capacity was >80%, it became very apparent that retrieving any file off of this drive was going to take a very, very long time, if ever!My advice would be to stick to the 2TB drives. At least you won't lose all your files to a drive that does not allow you to get anything off of it."
2157,5,Funcional,"Perfecto para quienes deseen almacenar su información, documentos, archivos, música, etc. en un disco duro seguro y adecuado. Tal como lo describe el vendedor."
2158,5,Baf,Stop working after five months
2159,5,calidad y confiabilidad para los respaldos,para respaldo de mi PC
2160,4,Return,Its size is a little too big for my space.
2161,5,it downloaded many games and i now have good space to stream,it downloaded many games and i now have good space to stream
2162,1,This product is NOT compatible with a Mac!!!,I had to exchange multiple times because it was formatted to Windows and ultimately had to return and go with another company.Too bad really because I have always relied on Seagate for my backups.
2163,1,Doesn’t work,"The package was fine and the hard drive has tons of storage and is fairly small so five stars for those but the main function broke for me. When I set it up for my console, it worked for a few minutes and then just stopped working and it stopped recognizing it. I tried plugging it in in another and the same thing happened, which says the drive is broken and I can’t get a refund because I already threw away all the packaging, yay."
2164,1,Failed within two months,"I used it for two months, then it just started to fail and it couldn’t be saved, had to get a new one."
2165,1,Was not compatible with my MAC,Bought this thinking it could be great to store my pictures. Plug it in and nothing. Not compatible to MAC as it is advertised. Was very disappointment. Returned the item.
2166,5,Chefs kiss for PS4 or ps5,It was so nice to to be able to download more games on my PS4 selling having to delete all of them and only get one and I’m looking at Warzone right now😐
2167,3,Isn't actually 2TB,It has a little over 1800 gb
2168,5,Very compact and easy to use!,I bought a 2TB hard drive from this brand a few years ago and it’s just now filling to the top. This one is gonna last forever!!!
2169,2,I expected it to be kind of slow.,It's really slow using USB-A. I haven't tried it with USB-C yet. Hopefully USB-C will be much faster.
2170,5,Works Great on PS5 for Storing PS4 games,Purchased for my son's PS5. Works great for playing and storing PS4 games.
2171,1,Disappointing,No software or written instructions on backup process. Support tried to help but voice connection was terrible.
2172,2,Died after 2 months.,Hard drive froze up after two months of use on a PS4. I can hear it buzz on and off but it never loaded up again.
2173,5,Fast,"Speed is good when you file transfer, capacity is around 3.6, loons great, comes with anti static fabric"
2174,5,Works sooo well,"Been using this for about 2 weeks now, and its so convenient and works sooo well. Havent had any problems works right out the box, just plug it in and go"
2175,5,"Great quality,good product👍",Good quality
2176,1,"Worked great, Until it didn't",It suddenly stopped working after 8 months. I do not recommend storing anything important on this drive.
2177,5,Does what it says,"I don’t have much experience with these, but it’s simple to use and works well"
2178,5,Approved,"These have worked well for me so far, no issues."
2179,5,You can’t open the application “Start_Here_Mac” because it may be damaged or incomplete.,"I am able to address this problem by watching an instruction video online. Basically, you need to erase the disk before using it. After erasing it I am satisfied to use it.======The hard drive only has read access permission and you can't write anything in it. Not sure if it is returned by someone before but I can't do anything for it. I had to spend a few hours to search for solutions online but still can't solve it. The instruction of the product definitely useless. I feel sad to purchase a trash. Already over 1 month since purchase date so I have to throw it away. Don't buy it!!!"
2180,5,Use it on a xbox,I hooked it up to me Xbox a year ago and it's been working great. Haven't had any trouble with it.
2181,5,Excellent,I loved it
2182,1,Poor shipping,"I tried my best to give the product the benefit of the doubt. I was really excited to be able to get 4TB of external storage at such a great deal. My Xbox had been run low on space for ages and this seemed like a great fix. My hope was greatly diminished when the package arrived. The clear plastic case it arrived in was incredibly oily. The description says it comes with a QuickStart guide as well as a micro-usb so you can plug and play right out of the package. On top of being oily, my package arrived barren, with no guide and no cable. At first this may seem like a small inconvenience, however I did not have a proper micro usb cable. The one I did have seemed to be faulty, as it would show a connection, but neither my laptop nor my Xbox could detect the drive. I ordered a high quality micro usb from Amazon, and after waiting for it to arrive, I was incredibly disappointed my Xbox one S still could not detect it. The cable I bought seemed to make it work on my laptop, but the main reason I bought this was to have more storage for games on my Xbox. I’ve been doing my best for the better part of a week to try and make it work, however at this point I’m throwing in the towel and returning the product. To those of you who wish to buy this product I wish you all the best of luck. I do believe the experience I had is a rare one, but to me it’s still the only one I’ve had with this brand"
2183,1,Confusing Instructions,"While Capacity and Portability are nice, better instructions a to insure it was working property is what I needed.After 14 hours it never indicated that is was done and I had only 3/4TB of data on a 2TB Seagate back up drive.Next time I'll try a different Company."
2184,5,Works as described,Aaa++++
2185,4,I think it's a great back-up disc.,"My only problem was that the instructions document wouldn't open on my new Mac. It took me a while to find how to get the instructions but once I did the upload was so quick it was amazing. Maybe the people providing anything to use with computers in this crazy new world should consider how we've dealt with things for so long and how frustrating it is to have something that always worked no longer function without an upgrade, or a completely new software system."
2186,1,Will not work after one year!,"We have had this drive for one year exactly and we can get to our files.I have tried three computers, two tvs, and the Xbox.Not one system can access them.I swapped the cable and it made no difference.The light comes on, and I can feel the drive running, but nothing will actually detect it.We also have a different seagate drive, and a Toshiba drive and they work fine."
2187,2,Unreliable - died unexpectedly,I used this as backup for my mac - using time machine. it died silently after 2 years. Luckily my mac is working so I'm fine.
2188,5,Works good,Just what we needed for storing all our photos!
2189,1,Stopped working. 3 months.,Stopped working. Had it for 3 months - didn’t move it once and took very good care of it.Don’t buy.
2190,5,He loved it.,Bought this for a gift. They loved it.
2191,3,Do not buy if you plan on playing 4K or above movie videos back off of this,The price is great the spaces great deportability is great but this thing will not play virtual reality videos or anything that’s above 4K or even 4K for that matter it’s great for pictures its great for low-quality videos its great for documents but not for VR at all
2192,5,5TB of storage,"Your getting what you paid for ,it great , using it for my Playstation"
2193,5,It's great,Easy to install storage good
2194,5,Great storage solution,I wanted a full system back up
2195,1,I think this is a fake,"1st it came in a plain brown box with no other info. I already have 1 seagate 1 tb hard drive. This new one is much lighter and looks different. it also feels cheap. The info on the back is different. When I put the serial number in, it says it expires Feb 2023 even though I didn't purchase this until April 2022 and it's supposed to have a full 1 year warranty on it. Sending it back :( Just pay the few extra dollars and get the real deal from Best Buy. The one I got from Best Buy looks and feels different than this one."
2196,4,Good Amount of Storage but Very Slow Speeds,It took many hours to back up 500GB of stuff from my PC to it
2197,5,"No brainer decision to buy another, larger capacity Seagate XHD.","No brainer decision to buy another, larger capacity Seagate XHD. All past ones performed flawlessly."
2198,5,Just what I needed to store items from my laptop,"This external drive provided all the storage capacity I needed when my laptop was starting to cause me problems.I didn't want to lose my pictures and documents and since Seagate is a well known brand, I purchased this for my own peace of mind."
2199,1,Broke after 1 year nd 9 month of use,Laster a little less then 2 years. When it first broke I thought it was the wire.The first wire was lost in the mail took a month to find out.Waitedwhile later to order another wire now it came.It was not the wire fault. warranty nd recovery ran out.So I lost all my stl.
2200,5,It actually WORKS in Mac,"I bought this item for my mac. After I connected for the first time, it didn't work. Something about an error. I went to the Amazon reviews and panicked since several comments said that the product didn't work on mac. However, it DOES work. You only need to open a program called Disk Utility on your Mac. You choose the Seagate External Hard and press ""Erase"". The disk will be erased. You just need to disconnect and connect again the item and you will be able to drop any document you want there."
2201,5,Dependable! Excellent Source of Storage!,"I've been loyal to Seagate ever since the one and only WD External I owned had fried over 15 years ago. Ever since switching to Seagate HD's I have never had another issue. I use their External for everything from backup storage, to running game files on my Xbox Series X, and running programs plus games off my ASUS RoG gaming laptop. The size is as close to 2TB as it can be, using minimal space for hardware files. 5 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! Incredibly reliable!"
2202,3,Do the job but little slow when you download and upload large files. But again the unit do the job.,
2203,4,Muy bueno,"Funciona a la perfección, no es inalámbrico, debes conecarlo a 110v"
2204,5,Works great for my old Xbox One,"Works Great, Good for price"
2205,5,Compatability,"Its a great product,the only downside is when you own an Xbox series S/X you have download those games onto the console itself rather than the portable drive."
2206,1,Don't buy if you have a Mac.,Definitely does not work for Mac! Purchased and plugged in and could not drop anything to it.
2207,5,Works as expected,"I wish more games could be played off external storage but the beauty of having one is moving or copying a game takes less time than downloading a whole one so it does save a lot of time. Works great, sleek and sophisticated. Hides behind everything well and looks good still pulled to the side. I fit all the games I could ever want on one of these."
2208,2,Super Slow and huge,"only thing good is storage space, but you will sacrifice in portability and speed"
2209,5,The future is here!,I can’t believe how small and inexpensive this hard drive is. Amazing! It works great!
2210,5,It’s everything that it said it would be and works great with my Xbox series S,I really like that’s it’s cheaper than other hard drives and it works great. The only downfall is series X/S games can’t be played directly from the external hard drive you have to move your games back and forth between the external and internal hard drives but the moving process is much quicker ( at least for me ) than deleting and redownloading games so definitely a great addition!
2211,2,It worked for just over a year.,"On Mar 27, 2021 I purchased an 8TB model to hold onsite nightly backups. It was replacing a 5 year old external drive (also Seagate) that had failed.The drive lasted just over a year and failed on Apr 2, 2022. I could be an outlier, but will give WD a try this time around."
2212,5,This works great on my ps5 small and portable,"2tb storage you can put alot of games on it,works great so I don't know if tech support is good,it is the same one as the playstation sells for cheaper!"
2213,1,Requires complicated reformatting for MAC,This says it works on MAC as well as PC.It only works on MAC if you take ten minutes to reformat it. And for me it didn't work then. I threw it in the trash.
2214,5,Thrilled,Was able to download 15 ps4 games on there and still have over 1TB space left
2215,5,Good product,This was a great purchase my fiancé needed storage space for his PlayStation and he was super excited that this had a lot of storage space
2216,5,Perfect,This is so easy to use and store! Works great!
2217,3,Not for iPhone,Couldn’t return and bought for iPhone storage of photos and videos. Very discouraging I couldn’t return
2218,1,Crashed,This is the second Seagate 5gb external hard drive that I have purchased and has become un readable within a few months .. asphotographer losing my clients images is absolutely unacceptable
2219,5,very pleased,it does what it says it will do!
2220,5,Good buy,Seagate Portable 4TB External Hard Drive
2221,1,NOT WORTH IT,"Well to start off, this portable little fellow seemed a perfect purchase for the price. Until two months in when it stopped working and literally REFUSED to connect. Oh, and, it began beeping nonstop. I lost all the hours of data and work that I had put on it with no hope of recovery. That was the FIRST one.I made the mistake of purchasing ANOTHER one and it went to pot TWO MONTHS LATER, yet again with the refusal to connect and the incessant beeping. Absolutely rubbish this thing is. Breaking with absolutely no rough handling and within a few months. There goes all my work and data yet again!I spoke with tech support and they said it will take a MONTH to send a replacement warranty drive with the recovered data. A MONTH.Ladies, gents, and all you other royals in between, DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A LONG TERM, DURABLE HARD DRIVE!"
2222,5,Perfect for my ps4,No more having to decide if I need to keep a game or delete it
2223,5,Great,Wonderful item
2224,3,"It's a drive, it's big.It was packaged poorly.",Definitely won't choose Amazon-day delivery next time.It was loose in the shipping container.But!It survived that and is running great as a backup drive now.
2225,5,Reliable,Storage capacity never feels like it runs out and it’s super easy to plug in and put to the side.
2226,1,Crashed and Deleted Photos,"I bought this harddrive because my old external drive was full and I could no longer load pictures into Lightroom because I was out of storage space.So I bought this HD and started the process of migrating my albums to this drive, one group at a time. The file sizes are large so I set it to copy to the new drive and went about my other tasks. The first migration went smoothly and I double checked to make sure all the files had transferred to the new drive.So I deleted the file from the OLD HD and proceeded with the next batch.Much to my dismay the new HD CRASHED deleting my photos. I used a recovering program to recover the photos back to the old drive, scanned the new drive and made repairs. I tried again to merge photos and at first things went smooth.My files transferred over and things were fine. Then yesterday, Lightroom stops importing my photos and states that the drive has been disconnected. WTH?!?!?! So I go to file explorer and sure enough the drive has been disconnected and the picture file I had previously transferred over with ALL MY SONS CLUB SOCCER PHOTOS has disappeared!!!!!!!!! They are gone.Deleted.I am currently running another recovery program on the drive and as soon as I recover my photos I will be sending this piece of crap back and buying a different brand that I have had previous success with.I am so livid right now."
2227,1,Paid for 5 tb and got 4.5 tb even after I formatted it. Can someone please help rectify this?,Paid for 5 tb and got 4.5 tb even after I formatted
2228,5,Outdoor Hardrive,"This product works great.Quick story though you will appreciate more.I purchased this external hard drive.Quickly downloaded all my photos and videos to this bad boy in no time flat.My amazing wife walks in and asks what I’m doing.I said I’m downloading all my files, photos, videos to this so we have a backup of everything.She said “Those Outdoor Hard drives are really something”.My wife doesn’t talk to me anymore but let me tell ya this outdoor hard drive is really worth every penny."
2229,5,One of the BEST Backup Drives,"I have another Seagate portable drive that I've had for quite some time and it still works perfectly.I decided to get a second backup, so I looked again to Seagate and this one works just as well.It's incredibly easy to drag and drop files.However, I have to agree with other reviews that if you're transferring a very large file it does take quite some time.This is a backup for my home computer, so I'm not as much concerned about the speed as I am the durability, easy of access to files transferred, immediate recognition of the device upon plugging it into my computer and the fact that's it's small and can easy be tucked away in a safe or luggage when traveling.I can VERY highly recommend this drive!!"
2230,5,I don't want to leave a note,Liked
2231,5,good quality,"I recommend, I have one since 2020"
2232,5,5/5 stars!,"works great , no complaints!"
2233,5,Awesome,I backed up my old computer and my new one.
2234,5,Worth Having This Product,Thanks For This
2235,5,Perfect,"Worked welll man , wasn’t hard to connect it worked like an charm no problem at all and quick delivery"
2236,5,It good,"It does what it needs and has been doing well, would buy again"
2237,1,FAKE HARD DRIVE!,"I received a fake hard drive or the insides were taken out, because the weight of it is very light compared to a normal external hard drive. Very disappointed!!!Also, it didn't come in brand packaging, and when you plug into computer it doesn't open. I'm so over the SCAMS!!!"
2238,5,SPEED,OUTSTANDING DRIVE
2239,1,Worst thing I ever purchased,I have been trying to backup my macbook for 3 days. It’s only 100G but the hard drive keeps crashing. Can’t be more simple than this. Do NOT buy
2240,1,Failed After 5 Backups,I bought this for my Time Machine backups. It failed (drive undetected) after about 5 backups. I called Seagate. They want me to pay to return it - plus there’s no way for me to wipe the drive before I do. I guess I’ll take a loss and just destroy it on my own. Never buying Seagate again.
2241,2,It goes bad quick,"After about 6 months of using the product it started beeping, i replaced the cord and tried everything a d hard drive just stopped working after 6 months"
2242,5,Good.,Bought this for my sister. She loves it!
2243,4,Good,"I’ve had it for about a year and a half and still works fine , although there is sometimes a disconnecting issue when moving it around. other than that it’s all good"
2244,5,Great,Worked great on my son’s Xbox
2245,5,Great product overall,Great product overall
2246,5,Very good!,"Works nicely. That’s all I really have to say on it, it stores games on my xbox nicely and it’s an awesome price ration"
2247,1,"If you're a MAC user, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HARDDRIVE","I bought two of these harddrives. The first one arrived, and was damaged when it was plugged in and not able to work. So I returned it for the same exact model, and the replacement came and was NOT compatible with a MAC, only windows. This is my 2nd and last time returning this item, I will never use SEAGATE again, returning for a different model, seagate is trash!"
2248,5,Best and cheapest option,"I search a lot of external hard drives but u can tell you this is the best for the price, fast and good quality, works on Mac. Best option!!"
2249,5,Storage is ACCURATE.,4TB is superb. I can put a lot of files on my external drive.
2250,5,Great buy!,This is a typical Seagate HD. When i owned a computer shop Seagate is the only HD went into my computer builds or replacement drives. They never came back. Others did. I love this portable drive for my laptop and have a larger desk model on my desk computer.
2251,5,Sleek compact design with tons of storage,The storage drive is compact and easy to carry with me. I purchased an Amazon Basics case to keep it protected and looking like new.
2252,5,Lightweight and fast,"The hard disk is awesome, easy to use, plug and play. It is fast and lightweight, making it easy to carry around."
2253,5,18TB external,"18TB is great, much slower than an SSD but also much less expensive, hopefully it will last as long as my previous Seagate drives."
2254,1,stopped working after a few months,This drive worked great for a few months until it stopped working and wouldn't backup my data. Kept telling me that it only had 56GB available. It's a 1TB drive.
2255,5,awesome!!,when i plugged it in that things pop up so quickly!! i love it!!!
2256,5,So far so good,Let's see it it lasts. Addition for my sons XBOX system
2257,4,Works great,It done it's job letting me have alot of memory for my games.
2258,1,Failure after few months,Failure after few months
2259,5,Definitely worth the purchase!,"Easy to set up and use. I was able to get my files transferred over to the new hard drive in no time. Well worth the money spent on it. And due it's size, it'll be far easier to transport the next time I have to travel."
2260,5,Need low cost storage buy it,Works just fine for low cost USB storage.
2261,5,Good and easy to use,Small portable
2262,4,Great,Wonderful product
2263,4,Longevity for my Xbox.,"Yeah, screw buying the new systems. I'm keeping One X, which honestly isn't that old yet. I'm so glad I got this, I was about lose storage space and now I'm content and have more room for content (boom boom tshh). This should last my Xbox for the rest of its lifetime. I recommend getting if you're planning to expand your library for your console or not yearning to buy a new one."
2264,5,Its working great so far for Xbox One,Weve had it for probably about 2-3 months now and its doing great for our Xbox One. Weve had no troubles so far. Hopefully we wont run into any in the future!Thank you!
2265,5,Excellent.,For me it's excellent. Enough for my storage needs.
2266,5,Well worth it,My daughter wanted this for her birthday she loves it
2267,5,works good,im happy
2268,5,Seagate is the highest quality for the price.,Great capacity for the money.
2269,1,Died after 4 months,Was working great on Xbox..but just died after only 4 months.This is horrible
2270,5,Excellent product,I got this for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. It is sturdy and reliable. And can recharge his phone e at least twice before he has to recharge it. Highly recommended
2271,5,"Portable, fast.",I am using this as a portable backup for my Linux laptop.Formatted as ext4 it is running 40MBs to 100 depending on what I am doing.Seems very good so far.
2272,5,Ps5,Ps5
2273,1,Stopped working the after three days,"During the third day of using the new drive, it completely stopped working.Disk recovery utilities see there is a drive but cannot read or write to it.Returning for something more reliable."
2274,5,Excellent product,"The product is exactly what I needed. I now store most of my games on it and still have room for other things. I do encourage customers to know exactly what they need so that they are satisfied with what they may purchase. For example, I bought the 1TB port and have used over 50% it very quickly, but have room left to work with."
2275,5,My go-to Time Machine backup,"With all the threats of cyber attacks, I wanted to make sure I was backing everything up regularly.This product is my go-to storage device for my computers - laptop and desktop. All macs and it works great with Time Machine."
2276,4,SLOW,Thanks
2277,5,Love the brand and the size,2tb is going to come in ahndy playing my new playstation games
2278,5,Daughters Birthday Gift. She loves it.,"Got it for my Daughter's birthday, she needed it for school. She loves it, so I can't say no more. (It came in a lil earlier than I wanted. lol.)"
2279,5,Yess,I loved it! It was easy to set up and Im not the best at tech things.
2280,5,Works great,It’s great. That is all.
2281,5,Both items are working well.,I use it for storing files.
2282,5,100% Recomendado,"Lo utilizo en mi XBOX SERIES S, y aunque claramente solo me permite descargar en él los juegos que no son de nueva generación, funciona perfecto y de velocidad adecuada para lo que se está buscando. 100% Recomendado."
2283,1,Seagate = nogate,"I ended up returning both the 2T and 1T Seagate portable hard drives that I purchased.Both would disconnect while transferring files from another HDD.During transfer, the HDD would stop working and no longer show in my PC's file screen.This was during transfer of larger folders up to a few GBs."
2284,1,Mac User,"Just unboxed this 5TB Hard Drive and less than 24 hours later, I'm looking to return. Main issue is connectivity. After countless plug in , unplug and plug back in attempts, I was only able to successfully connect just 1 out of maybe 40 attempts. Once connected, a few large files of 4gig size took 10 hours to copy to the new hard drive. To troubleshoot the problem, I plugged in every usb accessary I have and they all successfully connect on the first attempt. Im sure the product is legit, but I may have received a faulty one."
2285,5,Recipient loves it!,Purchased this as a gift for a friend with a laptop. He’s stoked about it. It fits his needs perfectly and he hasn’t reported any issues with it in over a year of use.
2286,5,It helped me store some of my important files and pictures I needed,Definitely would recommend it to anyone who needs to transfer a large portion of files or keep a bunch of files if your using your own or public computer
2287,5,Shucking,"Contains ST4000LM024.While not the BEST drives for a NAS, 24 of these with NVME cache gives amazing density to any enclosure designed for 2.5"" 15mm drives. Performance on these is what's expected of a 7200 rpm 2.5"" drive, about 200MBps read and 120MBps write."
2288,5,Doublemy space,Easy to install and get up and running. The plug and play is totally effortless.
2289,5,best value.,I bought this for my xbox one the 2tb one. When the storage device came I had 5 games installed now I have 49…. with still 700 gb left. I was looking through devices and some people want 150$. This costed me $60 and works perfectly fine. Comes with 3 warranty. Don't waste your money on other ones. Get seagate. It’s the cheapest and has the most value.
2290,5,Hard drive,Recommend
2291,5,buen producto.,sin comentarios.
2292,5,Good,This was a purchase for extra storage for my gaming system. I have a laptop with hardly any space and this is giving me plenty of space and it was easy moving the files over.
2293,5,A nice portable external hard drive,It works just GREAT
2294,1,After 4 months stop working and never turned on again,It's lightweight to carry everywhere
2295,1,Only 238gb of space on it,The media could not be loaded. Only 238gb of space. I ordered a 2TB external hard drive
2296,5,Excellent external hard drive!,"This HD is about the size of a laptop HD and just as light. Plugged it in to my PS4, formatted it and immediately moved game files to it. I would recommend this 100x over."
2297,5,Works Great but. . .,Looks as shown. Works great. Lots of storage so far.Best price I found for storage amount.Just wish tech wasn't so expensive.#capitalism_is_evil#capitalism_sucks#corporate_greed
2298,1,Died in less than a year.,"I used this to back up my gopro videos from a bucket list motorcycle trip.I moved it from the home to the library to edit my videos.It died today.Just a low buzz every 3 seconds.Won't mount.Seagate diagnostics doesn't detect it, so it can't be fixed.Very upset.Won't buy another seagate product."
2299,5,Buena calidad,Todo perfecto
2300,1,Dead or damaged port,"Stored this item for a while after realizing it wouldn't work with my laptop. No big deal, always need backup media storage. Go to use it today and it won't work on any of our desktops - it was a faulty port or device after all. No troubleshooting works & too late to return. Normally have good luck with this brand but wouldn't recommend this one."
2301,1,this product is not compatible with a macbook pro,
2302,5,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive,"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox - 1-Year Rescue Service (STGX20004. Got this for one of my Grandsons' new computer setups. He likes to play RPG & FJPS Games w. high end graphics. I have never had a problem with Seagate products and expect this HDD will perform as others I have had building my own computer systems."
2303,5,So far so good.,Perfect back up for my PC
2304,5,It works with PS5 to extend storage,Does what I needed it to. ADD SPACE TO MY PS5!!!
2305,5,portable hd that works,"well it is waht it is and does what it’s supposed to what more do you want … not as rugged as some but a small case would take care of that if you have cencerns, this one just needs to be ‘grabbable’ in an emergency."
2306,1,The 6TB Desktop HDD Model is Junk,"Only had it for 3 months before running into issues. Upon attempting to move files from this drive to another drive the transfer rate goes well for a bit then plummets to 1 ~ 15MB, then none, all the while accompanied by loud* rash mechanical whirring sounds that I've never heard before.I have purchased about 10 Seagate drives over the past few years; the smaller 2TB external variants and internal drives and I've never had an issue until now, but I'll never purchase a bulky expansion HDD external model like this again.Edit: I lost 5TB worth of data, countless family recordings and images gone. Every time the drive is plugged in now it causes the entire computer to hang and must be forcefully restarted, all the while the drive making loud unusual whirring noises that persist even after the PC is turned off."
2307,5,GOOD PRODUCT,I have used many of the Seagate Portable Hard Drives.From 1 TB to 5 TB.They have all performed well and lasted a long time.
2308,1,I looked up external hard drive for PS4,I looked up external hard drive for PS4. But my fault for not paying attention to it and wasn’t good for ps4. It wasn’t made for ps4.
2309,5,Works great,Extra storage
2310,5,It's good for ps4s,I used it for my PS4 and it works nicely. It's a bit annoying if you got it wall mounted because the cable is so short but it works
2311,5,Exactly what I needed,This product was exactly what I needed. I needed to upgrade my 10+ year old external hard drive. This has 4x more storage and is smaller/lighter than my old external HD. Highly recommend this product.
2312,5,"It is light, compact, and easy to use.",It is very easy to use.It is light and compact.No complaints.
2313,1,what,"it seriously failed when putting stuff onto it again. only had for 2 years, would have expected to last way longer"
2314,5,Excellent product,Excellent product. I would recommend it to any one
2315,5,Love it love it,Love it
2316,1,Opened up and didn't work,"bought in January 2022 and its now march 2022, I just now opened it because I used up the last space on my other one so its too late to return. first and last time I use seagate"
2317,1,Horrible,I had this product for 9 months and I used it only twice. I went to pull up datatype that I saved on it and it's beeping. I tried to gfifure out what it is and said the hard drive is bad. I spent $65 to use it twice and it doesn't work. To say I'm ticked off is an under statement especially when I saved my family pictures on it. I pray I can find some way to retrieve them.
2318,5,great for ps4,"Works great with the ps4, has plenty of room for games."
2319,5,I love it,No problems with this brand Hard Drive.
2320,5,It has more than enough storage.,"Did what I needed it to do , though I did have to use an adapter."
2321,5,Excelente 👌,Muy bueno
2322,5,Awesome,Small in size but holds all my games and more. Recommended
2323,3,Switching between ps4 and ps5 is easy,"The product was great, but they delivered it to the wrong door"
2324,5,Light weight and portable.,Great value for the amount storage space. Very light weight and portable. Quick transfer speed. Highly recommend.
2325,4,Not transportable and slow,I have had no issues with this drive other than it is slow and not transportable.I needed a drive to hold my music files and I feel they are safe on this drive.
2326,5,Good for ps4 and ps5,It’s a good storage for ps4 and ps5
2327,2,Trash,FYI they kept $20.00 for restocking fee.. it’s garbage .. just run
2328,5,Excellent hard drive easy to usere but I returned it beside two by mistake,Good hard drive but I bought two by mistake
2329,5,Easy to use,Love it
2330,1,Disappointed didn't work and no one could have helped me not even a return !!,Didn't work no one could have helped and no one tried to send me a return
2331,5,Great space,"I had to fix it to use on my Mac, but it wasn’t that hard. It has a lot of storage which I need and love how simple and easy it is to store."
2332,5,Seagate makes great external hard drives.,"Great external hard drive. I've had some external hard drives go bad on me. but the two other Seagate dives I've got have been working just like they are suppose to. Buy Seagate, you can't go wrong."
2333,5,Bueno,The media could not be loaded.
2334,5,Lots of storage space,Thank you i love it
2335,5,good value,Works as advertised
2336,4,"Slow, but does the job.","A good high value drive. I use it for backup and storage. it is too slow for video production or high throughput tasks, but it is a high value gigabyte per dollar drive that is fine for storage and backup needs."
2337,5,Love this,The 2TB USB flash drives are fakes. Get this instead.
2338,1,DO NOT BUY,"This thing just stopped working for no good reason at all, and apparently, if you read the other reviews, this is not an exception; it's the norm."
2339,4,Solid storage works without having to download anything,Good storage to free up space and have all the games you want without having to delete them because of full storage. I used it for PlayStation 4
2340,5,LokenClan,Very fitting and placed inside our Cyberspace storage needs
2341,4,Easy to install.,Would purchase again. Able to use on game systems as well as PC laptops andcell phones
2342,1,It crashed after only having it for four months,Crashed after four months
2343,5,"Great, but be aware of using with next gen consoles","Great for xbox! However, new-gen consoles that have Series X/S optimized games cannot be used as it requires a faster storage device."
2344,5,good for xbox or gaming consoles,Bought for my xbox works great lots of storage
2345,4,not Quite 2 tb,It was like 1.7 tb but I’ll never use that much storage so I’m okay with it
2346,5,This works perfectly.,Just like an extended hard drive.
2347,5,Refurbished and work's great,Download 100 movies and is only 40 % full could possibly download 400 more movies
2348,5,Works with Xbox,Bought this for my kids Xbox and he loves it
2349,1,Bad USB port and backup software,"It doesn't matter how little an electronic product cost if the electrical connection goes bad. I barely use this drive but the USB connection already is dicey at best. In addition, once you start the backup, the software interface doesn't do a good job of really showing you what's happening with the backup. Yeah, it's cheap and it has a lot of capacity, but if it doesn't work, well what's the point."
2350,5,Works great with my Xbox to hold more games,Tripled the storage of my xbox and it's worked great since day 1
2351,5,Feels sturdy works fast simple plug and play.,I think this thing looks great. If you have a black/dark setup for your computer it’ll definitely fit in. It’s a little large for tossing in a bag or something but definitely portable enough to switch between pcs and laptops etc in home.Zero issues getting it to work and the speed is very nice.
2352,5,Xbox compatible,Plugged it right into my XBOX One and now I’m downloading all kinds of games. Great buy! 😃😃
2353,1,Never buy it,I've had this for 3 months and it just quit working. Tech support was horrible. Save your money. Cheap plastic case. Worst purchase I've ever made from Amazon.
2354,3,Did not come formatted for a MacBook. I didn’t realize I had to research and figure it out myself.,"If you are going to use this on a Mac, be aware that it doesn’t come formatted for your Mac. You will need to install a driver, possible reset some security settings (depending on iOS version) before you can even use the product. I have had other Seagate hard drives and they’re great. It would just be good to know this information about the work I needed to do before I could even use this particular one. If you’re in a PC or Microsoft, however, you’re all good to go."
2355,5,Good External For Games,"I use this drive for my games that I play fairly often. I have no issues with it, and so far it loads up better than my internal. Overall, I recommend this drive, it's easy to set up and keep everything safe."
2356,2,Not for Apple Mac,"First I want to say I have two other Seagate external hard drives in the past and been satisfied. I purchased this with the intent of using it on my new MacBook Pro. When I plugged in the drive, the Seagate Portable Drive icon appeared on my desktop. I opened it and got three choices, ""start here for mac,"" a windows option and a warrenty info file.I clicked on start here for Mac and a window popped up saying it could not open due to the drive be (something like faulty) or ""incomplete."" I called Seagate and although there were some language issues I patiently tried to stay on the line as the CSA said I had to format the disk. Long story short, disk utilities, click erase, CSA said what happened next was not right and started reading something about how ""although the drive is for Mac, it may yada, yada yada. I thanked her and have returned the item. I've never had a problem with Seagate before, but between the product not functioning and bad CSA service, I did return it."
2357,5,Works great!,I would recommend
2358,5,Deadass worked like a charm !,"Honestly it was super easy to set up literally annnnnyyyy body can do it ! I got the 4tb, I checked to see if it was true after plugging it in and yeah it was all there"
2359,1,Totally a waste of money,It doesn't work anymore
2360,5,Big storage for an extremely small gadget.,I am extremely surprised as to how small and light it is. The storage capacity is off the roof.
2361,5,Excellent Storage Device,This HD is excellent and reliable. Still working just fine. Was a good price.
2362,5,Good for PS4 Storage,This expanded the storage on our PS4 enough to where we could download other games that we own. I have no complaints so far.
2363,5,Muy practico,Facilitar el almacenamiento
2364,5,Storage,The storage that I have is more than enough I can save and backup everything.
2365,1,Not for macs!!,"This DOES NOT work with a Mac, if you want to use it for your Mac you will need to do reformatting. I was just looking for a drag and drop easy external storage but this is not it 😞 I should have read the reviews more carefully"
2366,5,Great purchase!,I bought this primarily as a backup device.It's very easy to use - plug and play for the most part.It's about the size of my iPhone so easily portable.Seagate makes a great product.Win win win.
2367,5,Best Cheap external storage device good for ps4,It’s really good for the ps4 for a 2tb it download a lot of games and I still have more room for games I would recommend since it’s only $60
2368,5,Great price for the size,"Bought it for my ps4, I have most games digital and my boys filled up the internal drive. This HDD did the trick and it still has space"
2369,5,Works as advertised.,Used this drive to back up many hours of documentary video for archival purposes.
2370,5,hard drive,It does what it says it does
2371,1,Dead on arrival,Plugged it in didn’t work bought it in advance for a gift and I went past the 30 days now they wont take it back
2372,5,Great Device,Does what it says.
2373,5,Easy to use,"The product was easy to use, automatically set up when plugged into system without any hesitation or hiccups. It has plenty of storage capacity for all my photos, music, and documents."
2374,5,Works as expected,Worked as expected
2375,5,"Better buy two, so you can back up the first when it takes a crap on you","Well, at first this hard drive did pretty good, but after having it half loaded with music and karaoke songs. Approx. close to 1 tb of the 2tb capacity, it decided to take a crap on me.I spent hours trying to get the computer to recognize the hard drive washooked up but to no success. My wife and I tried hooking up to two other pc’s to confirm it was not a computer or software issue and spent many hours trying everything under the sun to get it working, and never succeeded. So it goes without saying I will never buy another sea gate product, especially when you have tons of hours and money invested in a product only 6 months old and you lose it all to a infierior product. Never again."
2376,5,Excellent,Good
2377,5,As good as advertised,I received it early and it has performed as advertised. would recommend to anyone that needs the extra storage capacity.
2378,2,XBOX SERIES X/S USERS BEWARE,It works for first generation Xbox ones but I have a series S and it's not strong enough to keep up with it it still holds my games BUT my Xbox constantly tells me that the data could at any time be corrupted or lost because the hard drive is too slow so I kind of just move everything I'm not using to it and I never run the Xbox off of it so it kind of sucks I have to constantly transfer whatever I want to do from the hard drive to the Xbox and vice versa. I will say it does it pretty quickly but it's still really annoying
2379,5,Buen producto,"Buen producto, es el mismo de la imagen funciona correctamente, llego a tiempo como lo decía la pagina."
2380,5,best,i like it it is genuine
2381,5,Perfect for what I need,It was able to hold all my data and thensome.
2382,1,1st one didn't work for MAC 2nd one had no MAC startup app,"First HD MAC startup was corrupt, second HD had no MAC startup option.I was forced to chat to resolve an unresolvable issue with a chat.The Chat wait was excessive so rather than try for a 3rd time, I just returned for a refund.I have ordered a different HD that is specific for MAC since this one in incompatible with MAC.If you have a MAC, look elsewhere."
2383,5,I receive item as described,Item arrived in good condition and fast
2384,5,Nice product and easy to use.,Nice product and easy to use.
2385,1,"Unreliable model, poor quality control","Due to the nature of my work I collect large amounts of data. For years, I have been buying new disks for storage and backup. Until a year ago, my experience with Seagate was good. A year ago, I would recommend buying Seagate external disks. This has changed over the last year. I have had problems with at least three Seagate Portable 5TB disks, Model STGX5000400. One disk, used exclusively for backup, fairly infrequently, and always handled with utmost care, just died. I spent the last two days trying to do something about it: CHDSK failed after running for a while; Seagate’s own diagnostic tests fail too. According to the Seagate Support page, the warranty expired a few days ago. In my opinion this disk qualifies to be legally considered a “lemon.” An exactly same model purchased at the same time shows similar troubling signs: the read and write times are incredibly long for some directories and files. It was used in the similar way, i.e., rarely, and always handled with care. When Seagate used to cover their drives with 5 years warranty periods, I haven’t had a single disk going bad. Every single one of those older disks still works, even though they were purchased a long time ago. Three of the recently purchased Seagate disks are already dead. Now Seagate sells disks with 1 year warranty, and there seems to be a reason for this: the quality of current Seagate disks is apparently greatly diminished. My advise is: stay away from Seagate Portable 5TB disks, Model STGX5000400, if you want to be spared lots of frustration, lots of wasted time, money, and the loss of valuable data."
2386,5,Simple and easy to put together,Just plug it up and never worry about storage unless you feel the need to own any game you see then get a higher one
2387,1,It's ok,Supposed to be portable but had it less than a yr and it stopped working on me. I only would disconnect to move like once a week if that and the last time I removed it and went to hook it back up it stopped working and I didn't do anything different from the other times I unhooked it and hooked it up again.
2388,1,it is not compatible with a mac unless you reformat.so much for plug and go...returning!,it is not compatible with a mac unless you reformat.so much for plug and go...returning!
2389,1,Not comparable with my ps4,Hooked it up says USB storage device is not supported.
2390,5,Easy to use,Purchased two of these as they store so much and are so easy to use.
2391,5,Love the amount of space,Just started saving to it but it easy and I have had no issues.
2392,4,"How to improve this drive's Windows ""Create System Image"" backup performance","I replaced another external hard drive I use to do Windows System Image backups. When I first plugged it in and did the backup it took 3 hours to perform a 140 Gbyte backup. Uncomfortably long time. I was able to reduce the time from 3 hours to 40 minutes by enabling write caching in Windows. This is outlined on Seagate's website, but here is a brief description:Device Manager-> Expand Disk Drives->Right-click the external drive ->Policies Tab->Select Better performance-Select Enable write caching on the device (only)I also disabled indexing on the external harddrive by using File Explorer->right click external drive->properties->deselect indexing."
2393,3,Not usable,For my playstation it will not work at all saying that the storage type is not compatible and for my Xbox it will not allow you to play games from game pass is they are located on the drive.
2394,1,Piece of S***,"What's the use in having 2TB of storage if you can't use it?At minimum, 4-5 times a day this device will cause file explorer to crash.I have to constantly toggle with the USB cord otherwise it won't load onto the computer.I would NOT recommend this hunk of garbage."
2395,5,Very happy with purchase,"I looked very closely at a number of different external drives. Settled on Seagate due to good ratings and price. The unit has performed perfectly over the two weeks I have had it.I noticed that some buyers gave low ratings for problems. This could be due to some devices just don't work properly andneed to be replaced. Or the buyer is challenged with PC usage in some way. That can happen to any of us.I would recommend this unit to anyone needing a portable, high capacity drive. I should add that my PC does not have USB 3.0, as I have an older model. Still, the speed of the drive is excellent."
2396,5,Gran capacidad y velocidad,"Los 2 TB que tiene son una capacidad suficiente para guardar información doméstica (fotos, archivos, documentos) y quedarse tranquilo que todo lo importante está respaldado, guardando archivos es muy rápido, además que es de un tamaño pequeño que es muy fácil de transportar y guardar."
2397,5,Just the space I needed,I needed space
2398,5,This thing is rad for the price,My only complaint is I bought it for an external hard drive for my Xbox one s and it will let me install all my games on it but says it isn't fast enough for certain newer games but thats just Xbox wanting u to buy there's
2399,5,The best,The Best
2400,5,They were large storage and cheap. With a plus.,Got lots of storage and even got a free month of my Adobe subscription. Win win. So far they seem to be exactly what I would expect.
2401,5,Great quality,Easy to use
2402,1,"Seagate Toolkit is the WORST, NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT","I bought this drive when I needed a larger backup device. It comes with ""Seagate Toolkit"", a totally worthless piece of software. I had added many new music files to my Music collection. When I went to check if these files had been backed up a few days later, I saw immediately that they were NOT. I noticed that the client application which starts each time I start the computer and login would not let me backup now. The entire menu for controlling the backup operation was grayed out. But when I logged in to an account with Admin privileges, something I rarely do, then the backup proceeded. I tried NUMEROUS times to contact Seagate for an answer. They are pathetic and hopeless, not trained, not responsive and worse than searching google. But google had no answers except to point at the user manual which also had no answers. This client should back up the files of the user which is logged in at a minimum even if it does not backup other user accounts.Do you run Toolkit and think it is backing up your files? Better check. This product is worthless and I will never buy another Seagate storage device again. For USB sticks, use Sandisk. For SSDs, buy Samsung and for external SSDs buy Western Digital or Samsung."
2403,5,Absolutely GREAT product!100% recommend!,"Best bang for your buck on this one!I got the 2TB on sale. It got to my house very quickly.Also, it's very reliable and very fast.I even uploaded large files straight to the internet, and it was just as fast as my hard drive."
2404,5,Convieniet,Love this item. Now I don't have to back up my files on cds or dvds.
2405,1,LOUD!!!!!,"This thing is beyond annoying and LOUD. Even from another room it will grind, whine, and make noise and it's not even doing anything. I've had it for months and now it's too late to return but I HATE IT! It was noisy to start with but now I notice it more than ever and I've had several other HD's over the years and this one is by far the most obnoxious!"
2406,1,"Easily broken, company won't help","I bought this drive shortly after Christmas and it broke just barely over a month after I got it, meaning I could no longer go through Amazon to return it. When I reached out to Seagate themselves, they told me they'd either send me the materials to send back my old drive and then send me a new one once they'd received it, or I could pay extra to get the new drive first and send the old one after. Great start, I chose the former. I receive an email confirming my phone conversation with customer support-- then nothing after that, nothing about the order they had to place for this exchange or anything. It's been about a week and I've already received a customer satisfaction survey, yet no indication I'm going to be able to exchange this drive that does nothing more than utter a dull beep now that my computer can't recognize it. Save your money, Seagate won't help you."
2407,5,Great drive but connection is very short.,Would be better if had a longer attachment cord.
2408,5,tiny & huge!,"this is tiny , fast, durable & so easy to use- why wouldn't you use it????"
2409,5,Worth the money!,Worth every dime. It took some time to figure out how to install software to work with my Mac Air but once I figured it out… it’s been great and easy to transfer and save my data to.
2410,1,Stopped working at 1.69 TB of usage,"If you love the idea of losing your family photos, videos, and work files, this is the perfect drive for you.It stopped working at around 1.69 TB, far less than half this drive's capacity.I can't even reformat it, as the drive inside just spins and can't be read by either a PC or Mac."
2411,5,good quality hard drive,"works well, no issues"
2412,1,Extremely slow!,Do not buy this drive.It is extremely slow.Took me over an hour to back up 200GB images.It took 10 minutes using another portable drive.Even backing up Word documents takes this long.I am putting in the trash and using other drives.Life's too short to wait and wait...
2413,4,Nothing to add,NTR
2414,5,Es muy bueno,Fue un regalo para Mi nieto le gusta jugar y dice que es excelente
2415,5,Very nice back up drive,Drive works as expected Ted.Good product.
2416,3,12.7 TB not 14 TB!!!,"Just a heads up to those that may not be aware, this hard drive is not a full 14 TB (none are but this feels like more of a rip off than usual). This seagate and the WD both are only 12.7 TB."
2417,3,Works but will not play video well,I purchased this drive to dump gopro footage to for playback and editing.The read speed is so slow I can not play back video without waiting more than watching.
2418,5,Gaming,"I didn’t have a bunch of storage on my ps4 slim and I only had 3 games, but this drive allowed me to have as many as I want."
2419,2,Interference,"I use this on my ps4 and it works great but if I play a game that is on the ps4 hard drive while it is plugged in it makes my wireless controllers unoperable, they sorta do their own thing whenever the hard drive is ""thinking"" for lack of better words"
2420,5,Great for Series X emulation and Xbox One/360 games,"There's not much more to say.Due to the 1TB SSD capacity on the Series X, all my Xbox One and 360 games run off this bad boy.I have no issues, they load faster than you'd think, especially 360 games.I also have 2TB of ISOs and ROMs that I have stored for Retroarch, and now that you can run ISO >2GB off an external HDD now, this is where they all go, no problem.I have no issues with this thing.Buy it if you're in the market, or buy an enclosure and buysomething bigger."
2421,5,Perfect for pc and gaming,Lots of extra memory for gaming and files
2422,1,Did not work after 2 months,Seller refused to refund
2423,5,Still going strong!,I ordered this thing a few years ago.It's still going! :D Quality!
2424,5,Easy to Use,"Easy to use, can be setup to backup automatically and holds all my music and pictures."
2425,5,Works as advertised,"Easy setup and works as advertised. Plug in and start saving games after easy setup. (I have PS4) to have 1tb, it’sa great value. Would recommend for price and simplicity! 👌🏽"
2426,1,Busted within a month,"After just under a month, this drive stopped working. All the files are inaccessible. I lost three years of game design work. The light on the drive just blinks and it never loads. I thought I was getting a deal on this drive, but I ended up losing far far more than I saved. There's an entire part of my life that... I don't know where it goes now because of what I lost using this drive. A really bad experience that has in no way been remedied. My only clues of what to do next are in the other one-star reviews for this product."
2427,5,Me gustó mucho funciona muy bien,El disco duro es muy compacto y funciona muy bien
2428,5,Works as described,"I'm using this on an iMac, with Time Machine.Seems fine."
2429,4,Works out of the box,"Set up is easy. Loading files is smooth, but too soon to tell other features."
2430,3,Single port,"The single port is a problem, as drives cannot be serialized."
2431,5,Worth it! Works with Xbox One,My Xbox One is the original and only had 250gb. This external hard drive is great! Now I can download multiple 50-100gb games at a time and don’t have to worry about the storage. Definitely worth it!
2432,5,I'm using it without any problems.,There's no problem backing up data.Bad sector or hardware problems have not yet occurred.
2433,3,Slowest transfer rate . But overall not bad,It takes 3 hours to move two small files. Don't waste your money.
2434,3,Loud. Works great.,"Works great, but this thing is at least twice as loud as my previous backup drive."
2435,2,DOES NOT WORK WITH PS4,"I got this hoping it would work for my ps4 despite all the reviews that said it doesn’t work but listen to those reviews because I hooked it up to my ps4 and it worked for 1 day before it just broke I hadn’t moved it or done anything to it, it just stopped working so listen to those other reviews that say it doesn’t work with ps4 because they are right"
2436,5,Great Storage For Peace of Mind,"Nothing better than feeling protected with your data.I was bad and forgetful about securing my photos and other important documents off my computer until I was forced to when my hard drive crashed.I immediately purchased this back up drive and so glad I did.I now have everything backed up!!!! don't be like me and wait until catastrophe happens and lose all your data.Be safe get one of these.Everything is now backed up and this particular drive has tremendous capacity.I downloaded over 5,000 pictures, files and there is plenty of room to spare.Highly recommend it for PEACE OF MIND!!!!!!!"
2437,5,Excellent!,...the ease of usage and satisfied secure feeling knowing where everything is safely placed away!Excellent... just excellent!
2438,5,Backing up The Cloud…,"I do use The Cloud to back up my files, but, like many, I have concerns it could just go “puff” one day, for all those assorted reasons, like “Stuff Happens,” as a former Secretary of Defense once proclaimed. So, I also like the idea of all my files on a device that I control, 100%, and fits in my shirt pocket.2 TB is sufficient storage to retain all the photographs I’ve taken over the last half century, as well as all the written words. Both are literally priceless, at least to me.I notice that some reviewers have groused about transfer speeds, but for most of us that is not the highest priority. Moving pictures to the hard drive is a one-time affair, and who amongst us is old enough to remember when one left the computer run all night long?After a month’s usage, the files have been successfully retained, with no copy errors.I’m impressed that this one item has 186,000 plus reviews, the most I have seen for any product. The vast majority are 5-star rating – to be precise, 84%.The only thing left is the price: $60 is a good price to pay for the additional peace of mind. 5-stars."
2439,5,Holds all my games for my pc!,Its portable! Yay!! This thing is fast. Its a bit noisy but hey that's alright with me. I like the storage space. Would recommend.
2440,5,great,"i bought this for my xbox after having my other one completely stop working with only a month of use, and it’s been great!! great price and it’s nice looking. i have no complaints and will update my review if anything changes"
2441,1,Beware fo these drives,"Bought two of these.First one failed int he first week, second one failed in 5 months.Heads up."
2442,1,Doesn’t work,I just received this in the mail today and it does not work. I can’t copy and paste anything into it and the tech-support is not 24/7. Very disappointed.
2443,1,Two in a row that didn't work.,"The first drive would not even format. The second drive locked up two minutes after trying to move files to it. Following that it would not work at all unless I unplugged it and plugged it back in. As soon as I tried to move anything to it, it went into an error. Seagate support offered to replace it ""if I did not want to keep it""? They said to send it back to them then they would mail another drive. Sort of strange when I can return it for a refund through Amazon. This time I am getting a refund."
2444,5,You gotta configure,I don’t like the process to configure…
2445,5,It’s on point.,Recommend and would buy again
2446,2,Looks good on paper--BUT!!,"It was fine , until it failed DEAD on about the sixth or tenth use.Now dead.And not even heavy enough to use as a paper weight"
2447,3,Very touchy and easily disconnected,"The connector to the drive's body is wiggly and the drive gets disconnected too easily. Even a slight movement of the cord causes it to get disconnected. This has already resulted in a partition that cannot be mounted [wasted space]. In fact, I'm fortunate I partitioned the 2 TB drive into 2 1 TB partitions before I started using it. I can only get one partition mounted. For the one that is corrupted, I had to go in and create another volume, which ends up isolating the used portion of the bad partition so that I can at least use that space.However, the easy disconnection is a real pain and risks damaging the drive. Very sad, since you never know if it will disconnect.Also, as others have mentioned, it's very slow. The cable might be the problem. Next time, getting a flash drive to time machine my mac.My advice: as soon as you can, partition the drive so if one section turns useless, you can still use the other partition. The useless volume sometimes appears and most times does not appear when I connect it to my Mac. Use DiskUtil to set up at least two partitions (not volumes). Use one for time machine and format the other exFAT so you can use it both on Mac and Windows. The exFAT partition seems more resilient than the APFS side. Once the APFS side goes bad, add additional Volumes that can use the space that is still good."
2448,2,Stopped working after a week or so,Bought for Xbox one and worked perfectly but after a week or so it wouldn't get recognized on anything not the xbox not the pc NOTHING despite the hard drive is acting normal.
2449,2,this thing is stupid,this terrobyte makes you transfer your games and apps to your external drive and takes up all the space and you can’t download a bunch of games 5/10
2450,1,Doesn’t work,Took it to a computer shop to back up my computer - they said the hard drive was unstable and they refused to use it for a backup. It was right out of the box within a month of buying it
2451,5,It works as advertised,It's exactly what you think it is. You plug it in with a USB and know you have to storage areas where you could download what ever you need
2452,5,Absolute steal of a deal.,Works really well I was having problems with space on my ps4 and now I definitely dont. I can't even tell the difference in load times from before and after having my games on my system.
2453,1,Quit working after 4 months,"This HD quit working after 4 short months. It started beeping one morning and from then on, I could not access the data, could not get it to register on any computer (I tried multiple), and could not get it to work at all. After calling Amazon support, I was directed to Seagate directly since I was out of my return window. It was a long and ardous process with Seagate to get a replacement sent and even then, I had to pay for shipping back and forth.Maybe I got a lemon but I would not take a chance with my data on this HD again."
2454,5,Works great!,Just what I needed. Works great with the PS5. I bought a “used” option. It was significantly cheaper and worked great!
2455,5,A must!,Purchased to back up photos and it’s perfect. Easy to drag and drop files. I would highly recommend if you’re looking for extra storage.
2456,5,BUY IT!,"It’s great I definitely recommend, definitely getting more for what you pay for."
2457,5,Satisfied,"I don't know much about computer. This purchase was solely based on Amazon reviews on one drunk night. Also, I have never built a computer before so I had to do some research on Youtube. As many others suggested, I upgraded the ram part. The computer works great and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Wish hard drive had more storage available"
2458,5,"Exactly as described , works perfect for storing photos and other info",I bought to transfer some files and to backup our digital photos . Great quality and works perfect
2459,5,Solid stuff,"A number of months later, still works like a charm. Good price, good product."
2460,5,Going Strong!,"Been using this drive for my backup in TimeMachine for nearly two years now.Never had a problem and its still going strong.Very dependable, very easy to use."
2461,5,It has a lot of space to store favorite games.,I use for my XBox
2462,5,Perfect External Drive,This drive is perfect to fit all your files and have it ready to be removed at any given moment
2463,2,Worked great until it dosconnected,"I got this to hold all the games I play so that they weren't clogging up my pcs storage. It worked great until it connected and hasn't worked since. No computer I've tried hooking it up to recognizes it, I can't even access the files. It also beeps whenever its plugged in. I just can't get it to work. Glad I didn't have anything important on it."
2464,5,GREAT ITEM SO FAR,"Works like a charm, no issues here"
2465,5,Bought For My PS5,"Bought this guy for my PS5 to store my old PS4 Data on, and it works great! And for a reasonable price! Love it."
2466,3,No Instructions,This item has no written instructions.Had to go to Seagate website to find a phone number for tech support.The tech was very difficult to understand; but did manage to walk me through the installation and initial download process.I still don't know how to go to the Seagate to retrieve a file that may have been accidentally erased or wanted back to main hard drive.
2467,5,"A++ seller, just as described.","A++ seller, just as described."
2468,1,Macbook air,Do not buy if you have Macbook air. Does not work
2469,4,Overall stilL ok to buy,"Comparing to another 2TB Transcend HD I owned for many years since 2016.With similar size, Seagate(2021) is a little bit lighter.Others functionalities are similar, no great improvement.Bought this for PlayStation 4 Storage Extension.At least working great with PlayStation 4.Overall still OK to buy if you need a portable storage."
2470,5,Good item,I ordered this to store all my photos from my phone and from my trips. Lots of storage.
2471,2,Planned Obsolescence,This will be my first Amazon review.My warranty expired January 2022.This HD gave out February 2022.Thanks Seagate.
2472,5,Works great!,Works great for Xbox X. The only thing is that it can only download all the Xbox games except the new Xbox x games. You will need a special SSD card Xbox x made for the console or just use your internal storage.
2473,5,So Convienient,This drive is perfectly convenient for me! I use one for research and the other as a backup disk for my laptop with it set to backup daily. (I also back up to the cloud as an off site source). I find it to work smoothly and seamlessly in both cases.For my research I am frequently adding bits and long items on regular and irratic basis which this handles well.In short I would say that this appears to be an economic and reliable source that is well worth the purchase.
2474,5,Works with my xbox1,Storage for xbox. It works
2475,4,What a very convenient way to have ALL your information in one place !,This item has been shipped appropriately AND on time ! The data storage capacity is GREAT and the data Transfer Rate is Amazing for such a small form factor !
2476,5,Great,Great product
2477,5,Largest Seagate drive I now own!,"Largest Seagate drive I now own!And at the right price.As usually, Seagate drives are the quality external hard drives to get."
2478,5,fantastic,exactly as ordered
2479,1,Doesn’t work on ps4,"Originally said could be used on PS4 . But it doesn’t work, all it says USB file not supported. I also bought a Second one for my work laptop that works really well"
2480,5,Love it!,Super sleek and does the job well.
2481,5,Value Buy,Great portable storage for a great value.
2482,5,Great gift for my son the gamer,As described
2483,5,I LIKE PIE,I REALLY LIKE PIE
2484,5,A giant but small drive,"This drive is extremely small and compact, just look at the dimensions! Yet it holds plenty of storage and transfers rather quickly. This company makes great memory.There's not really another option out there for a drive this large at this price point, sure there are competitors, but they're all pretty similar."
2485,1,I should have read the reviews.Horrible product bad customer service,"The drive worked until just after the return period ended with Amazon.Now I have to send the drive back to OK and wait up until 30 days to see if they can retrieve my files.No refund and no guarantee,but they will send me back a new piece of junk instead of a refund.I trusted them with my files while backing up,I won't do that again.Stay away"
2486,5,Great portable hard drive at a decent price!,"I only buy Seagate or Western Digital products for my storage needs because they have never failed me. It's setup to run on Windows from the get go but I use Linux so I reformatted it to be more compatible. I have to do that with every portable hard drive I get but the process doesn't take long. It does have extra software on it but even if you use Windows you can remove it to free up more space on the drive. I'm not sure if you would have to reformat it for a Mac or not. Maybe check the description and see if its Mac compatible. I would think it is but I may be wrong. 2TB of space is a lot more than most people actually need but some of us have years worth of stuff we like to save. So if you have a lot of music, movies, documents, pictures etc, this would be ideal for you. Just remember it is a standard hard drive so if you drop it, especially on a hard surface, poof goes all your data. Not every time, that is if you're lucky, but a lot of the time that will happen or there will be damage to the hard drive that can cause read/write issues. Solid state drives are more reliable but also more expensive. Anyway for a 2TB portable drive at around $40 something bucks isn't a bad deal. As long as you're careful with it and do regular backups. Don't want to lose your data in a computer crash!"
2487,1,Stopped working within three months,I bought this unit in January and by March it stopped working. Don't buy this. Be aware that Seagate will only replace with a factory-refurbished item.
2488,4,NOT compatible with xbox series s & x!!,"ITS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SERIES S,X. It’s still a good hard drive I just wish there was more info and instructions on it. If your getting a hard drive for your series s or x make sure it specifically says compatible with it."
2489,5,They are a great product,This is one of the easiest hard drives to carry around and use. They are so good I bought two. They are compatible with PlayStation and PC. Great product I would buy again
2490,5,Not usable for video game storage they get very hot after 2hrs of gaming.,"I had purchased 1 extra before as a steam game storage but after 2hrs of playing between Gears5 and Soul Caliber 6, my character was teleporting back and fourth as if playing online with bad ping.I returned it for that problem but I still have my 1st purchased 2TB drive that I keep my anime on and it's perfect for that and storing other important stuff."
2491,1,Must reformat for MAC and support impatient,"I had a Seagate before - it was a plug in and go, but now you have to reformat for a Mac. I'm not computer savvy so I reached out to tech support for help by way of their chat option. It's pretty dramatic when you can tell someone is impatient over chat! Anyway, I aborted the whole mission and am returning this product. I was going to buy a LaCie but they have been bought by Seagate and I'm sour on the company, as of today anyway. I'm not sure where I'll go from here. If you know what you are doing, maybe this product would be fine, but if you are like me I hope you have better luck."
2492,3,SLOW,Copy speeds are around 1.0 mb/s So don't plan on quickly moving things around...
2493,5,Works as advertised and convenient.,Video editing between 2 computers in different locations
2494,1,Didn’t trust it,It just came between 2 pieces of plastic in an unmarked box. I returned it the day after I got it. No idea where it had been and didn’t want to connect it to anything.
2495,1,NOT FOR MAC,"The second time I'm buying Seagate hard drive, it doesn't work the second time. It says that it's for mac and windows (IN THE PRODUCT NAME AND DESCRIPTION), but they have only the WINDOWS installation program this time."
2496,5,Plugged in works great,"I plugged it in and it was ready for use pretty much immediately works great, it’s really nice to have the extra storage."
2497,5,One of my best purchases,I was able to put 4 flash drives onto the Seagate. It also means I don't need TeamViewer to connect with my computer. All my data is on the Seagate. Now I just plug it in to another computer and I have my computer. Very portable!
2498,5,Great little Portable Drive,It’s USB 3.0 so if your computer has a USB 3.0 connector it copies data quickly.I copied roughly 800GB in under 4 hours.I wasn’t timing the data transfer so numbers are not exact.Not really 2TB. More like 1.8TB so 4 not 5 stars.I’ve only had this one a month or two but have another Seagate 2TB and have used it for at least a year with no problem.I also have two 1TB Seagate drives and they work great too.
2499,5,Plug and Play,Simple to use. Plugged this 2tb back up drive into the USB port. The computer recognized it immediately and it worked seamlessly.
2500,3,How do they find me??,"It sounds like just what I thought I needed, and it sure looks nice, but...once again, a carefully chosen product might be yet another dud! The instructions are in 8 or 9 different languages, in a typeface that's impossible to read, so if you don't own a magnifying glass, pick one up first. I'm still investigating on- line help, so this review may be upgraded If I am successful. I don't like to leave negative reviews, so if this gets turned around, I'll change it accordingly."
2501,2,USB socket failing on unit,"This external HD functioned perfectly fine for a year, then the USB receptacle on the unit began to be unreliable.The make sufficient contact to the connector pins , now I have to torque the plug in ways that are going to exacerbate the problem, until it eventually completely fails.As a tech professional with electronics experience, even I am frustrated with the poor quality of this connector, as if it fails, it renders the unit totally useless.Cannot recommend this product.Will be looking fora replacement from a new manufacturer."
2502,1,Trash,"Sent me a defective hard drive, doesn't even work"
2503,5,Muy bueno,Se le adapto al play 4 a la perfección
2504,1,Doesn’t even work it just says there is an unknown,Doesn’t even work it just says there is an unknown
2505,5,Works like it should,It works for the price
2506,5,It works,Works well with my Xbox series S
2507,1,Stopped working after one day,"Was excited to transfer my files over to this external drive and declutter my pc, as I work with adobe suite frequently and storage space is currency. Transferred my files from laptop to this drive (about 350 gigs on a 2TB external drive), and the next day they were gone and my computer did not even recognize the device. Tried it on another computer with the same outcome. Super disappointing."
2508,5,Excellent performance,I used it to for my Xbox to add 2 TB of space. Its been great booting up my games at a faster rate than with the Xboxs HDD. Completely satisfied with it after 1 week of use
2509,5,Easy to install,I bought this for my 15 yo grandson to connect to his XBOX One. He did it himself in a couple of minutes. He's very happy with it so I am too.
2510,5,GREAT BACKUP,EASE OF OPERATION
2511,5,Storage,"If you love playing a lot of video games with a huge amount storage, then this is the best one for you. You can now have an extended storage where now you can download any game that you want with a lot of capacity."
2512,5,Review,THIS IS PERFECT FOR WANT I NEED IT FOR.
2513,1,Does not work on PS4,Plugged it into my PS4 multiple times and this same message pops up every time “This USB storage device’s file system is unsupported”. Very frustrating considering it’s advertised to be compatible with the PlayStation.
2514,5,It worked the first time!,Good value
2515,1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MAC PRODUCTS,"I bought this hard drive for additional storage during my doctoral program. I specifically sought out a device that was compatible with both Mac and PC so that I could complete work on my personal computer or off-site. At the close of the semester, I had used a PC to save course data and didn't think twice. I'm no trying to save research data & after 48 hours of frustration and a deep dive into Google search, I've come to find the device is actually NOT compatible with my personal laptop (Mac). Total waste of money & a major source of unnecessary stress."
2516,5,Very good item,this item is very good
2517,1,Isn’t compatible like it says it is,Says that it’s compatible with the PlayStation 5 but it’s not. It automatically says not compatible as soon as you plug it in
2518,5,Good so far,I don’t seem to be having any problems but I haven’t used it long enough either to leave a really good review. But it’s working like it should
2519,5,Excellent portable HDD drive,"I bought this external hard drive to run either Windows 10 or Cloud Ready on a laptop with a fried hard drive.Although I wasn't able to run Windows 10 (needs an SSD drive), I was able to run Cloud Ready (now Chrome OS Flex since Google purchased NeverWare) and have my laptop back without the heavy bill of replacing the hard drive.It's also nice to have a portable HDD drive to store files on."
2520,5,4TB portable external hard drive by seagate,"I bought this hard drive for my households multiple gaming files, digital art files to save until time to print. Packed securely no damage to box or contents ,Haven't needed tech support to hook up very self explanatory of hook up comes with cord and booklet with instructions in it. So far no problems to report besides the storage capacity the price was near the best i've come across for this type of external hard drive unit."
2521,5,Solved my PS4 storage issue,"I bought thisbecause my PS4 internal drive was full of games and stored files. While it did allow me to move and install applications on the external drive, it did not let me move files. Not sure if this is due to something I did when formatting the drive or just the way life is. Still, it solved the ""disk full"" error."
2522,5,Great price,Best price and selection around.
2523,1,Seagate support is horrid.They wanted to charge me for sending back a unit that didn't work .,"If you're trying to match an external drive to a Macbook, forget it.Not even the support people could fix it.There is absolutely NO instruction manual and the web site is woeful, making it necessary to call tech support.This thing didn't work right out of the box.Very bad experience."
2524,3,Slow; can't eject,"As others mentioned, it's very slow to write. The bigger aggravation for me is ejecting it. On my MacBook Air, EVERY time the backup finishes and I try to eject this drive, I get a message that it can't be ejected because a program is using it. The ""help"" section says to log out and re-try. That seemed to work but I don't know if I will still have problems next time."
2525,1,Terrible Experience,"I ordered 3 of these drivesOneCorrupted the first time I tried to use itThe second was shipped already open and used.Failed immediately.Looks like it was returned broken and then sent back outWho knows about the third.I will try, but not hopeful"
2526,1,"Formatting for Mac Failed, Now it's Not Readable - NOT FOR MAC","This drive comes formatted for Windows. The description says it works with Mac but when you try to use Disk Utility to format it a Journaled, the process fails and it is no longer mountable/readable. IOW, it's now DOA.We have other Seagates that work just fine. What's the problem with this model?"
2527,1,Dead within less than 2 months.,The drive died less than 2 months after I bought it.
2528,1,"Over 8 terabytes of memories, gone.","This is my first Amazon review after years of being a member. I have purchased many drives in the past to hold my photos and videos as to make space for my laptop and accumulated a decent stack. I bought this 12tb hard drive hoping to have a backup of all my photos and clearing my old hard drives for some large events that are happening this year and so I did. The write speed of this seagate is phenomenally slow and took an entire day to copy a 2tb hard drive. 4 days later and this external held my life's work, over 8tbs of photos in one place. One day I went to get a folder a client requested and the drive starting clicking and beeping. My computer was unable to detect the drive as it kept beeping and clicking. I unplugged the hard drive and tried it again. I used a different USB cable, different power supply outlet, nothing. My life's work is gone all thanks to the faulty construction or hardware or outdated mechanics, whatever caused this. Buyer be careful of this product. However tempting the price tag may be compared to a G Drive or SSD do not buy this product. Spend the extra hundred or whatever to get a better hard drive. Just not this one. Now I understand why they say ""you get what you pay for""."
2529,5,"as advertised, easy to set up plug and go",easy to set up and use
2530,5,Great,Great.
2531,1,A waste,"DO NOT BUY!!!, it messed up my ps5 and makes my game laggy everytime I plug it in. Save yourself some time and get one at Walmart"
2532,5,Xbox compatible and compact,Works seamlessly and flawless
2533,5,Great portable traveler + Pair with a vertical stand,"This light and small drive is great portable traveler.And 4-5TB capacity is perfect for compressed data backups.As others note, it does run warm to the touch when placed horizontally on the desk -- there be only one side to dissipate heat and no air circulation.I find that a 3D printed vertical stand works well to keep the drive much cooler.Then drive performance doesn't seem to degrade or hiccup.Several nice designs are on Thingiverse, search for ""seagate portable stand""."
2534,5,As Advertised,As advertised. Works well with my PS5 to ease up on my console storage space. 5-stars.
2535,1,Stops working after a year,I've gotten 2 of these now and both have stopped working shortly after a year.
2536,5,Good experience fast shipping,Great quality and reliable way to back up your computer or to store things on
2537,5,Great price for a lot of storage,Plug n play set up with this peripheral drive and a great price. Ordered it in the morning and it was at my door that afternoon!
2538,5,I reckon it's a good unit,"I'm not a computer geek, I needed this HD to augment an Allen Heath mixer so I could record. It formatted with no issues and works fine. IDK if better than others or not, but it works fine for my application."
2539,5,actual storage space is closer to 1.81 Terabytes,"works, a little bit of the space was taken up by the software that runs it, but i didnt care, i was going to buy the 1 Terabyte, but saw the 2 terabyte was only 10 bucks more. It had 1.81Terabytes of actual storage available. plenty for me."
2540,5,Works fine,Works fine. Easy to install.plenty of capacity.
2541,5,No Excuse,"The the capacity of these and the fair price, there is no excuse NOT to back up your data. Very easy to format and even easier to use."
2542,1,Does it do what it says?,It made my computer crash!!!!
2543,5,used to make system and file backup,Works so far....we'll see its long term performance.....
2544,1,NOT Compatible with macOS Monterey 12.2.1,"The listing claims this Drive is MAC Compatible so I purchased one, and promptly returned it believing it was defective. Then I purchased a second one and it too was not recognized by my late model MacBook Pro using OS Monterey 12.2.1 operating system. I went to the Seagate Website and there was a note that some Mac's wouldn't recognize some of the Hard Drives......which isn't mentioned in the listing. Fortunately, Amazon made both returns relatively painless.I have one of these Hard Drives that I use with my Dell Laptop and it has worked great for years which is why I chose it. Just be aware if you have a newer version ofMAC."
2545,5,It works!,It works really well so far for my ps4 just to keep it in mind if you use it for an Xbox or PlayStation make sure you go to devices and click stop using extended storage before unplugging your system or els it will mess up over time that’s what happened to my previous hard drive
2546,1,Garbage,Thing stopped working and lost all saved data. Apparently it’s a known issue with this drive. Highly recommend staying away from this type of drive or anything from Seagate. Absolute rubbish.
2547,5,Good Price and big storage capacity.,Liked the price and volume of data it handles.
2548,5,delivered on time,easy to install and good storage capacity
2549,1,Slowed down my MacBook Pro 2017,"When I plugged it into my MacBook, it slowed down booting up, locked up my keyboard and mouse."
2550,4,INITIAL review after setting up. Info on drive not showing up and reformatting for Time Machine...,"I'm writing this because of all the reviews I see complaining about the drive not showing up on their computer initially, saying ""it doesn't work right out of the box!"" I often wonder if some of these people never even read the documentation before giving up. The included documentation for the drives is horrible, with only a Quick Start page that shows how to plug it in, but there is great info on Seagate's site that helps if you go look at it. There's also something else I found out that might be helpful, and I'll address that here. Once I've had it in use for a while I'll update this review for a more in-depth account of how well it works. I'll list my comments by issue:1) Drive not getting recognized.After seeing so many ""it doesn't show up"" comments, I was concerned when mine didn't show up on my iMac either. I followed the instructions on plugging it in (in sequence, which may or may not make a difference, but you gotta do it correctly just in case), and the first thing you have to do is decide which US Standard plug to slide onto the universal plug adapter; there are two that are almost identical, two-prong plugs; one has holes in the prongs and the other doesn't. Docs say nothing about which to use, so I went with the one with holes.The unit powered up and sounded like it was initializing, but it wouldn't get recognized by my Late 2017 iMac. Unplugging and restarting did nothing. I went to the online documentation and did the recommended check to see if Show Hard Drives was checked in Finder/Preferences/Show-Hard Drives. It was (which I already knew because my others show there, but just in case I needed to recycle the command...). That did no good. After a bit of thought, I decided I'd try the other plug, and that did the trick. USE THE PLUG WITH NO HOLES IN IT if using in the US!Once that was solved, it showed up and all looked good.2) Using with Time Machine on Mac.The info in the product description says the drive is ready to use with Time Machine, preformatted. The problem is, if you have Catalina or later, there is a new formatting called APFS that replaces xFat, and you will have to reformat to use with Time Machine. This is a simple process using Disc Utility, and it reformats quickly.Once I had that issue solved, I got Carbon Copy Cloner (trial version) and set up the tasks of copying my main hard drive (348.3 GB) and my 8 TB external drive to the new Seagate drive and let it go. The main drive was backed up in just over 47 minutes. Yeah, it's a tad noisy, but nothing that can't go on while working on the computer by any means unless you're maybe recording a YouTube video at the computer or something.The external drive, which had 6.58 TB of stuff on it took a little longer... 12 1/2 hours to be exact. Slow? I don't know, it's the first time I've copied a hard drive with that much stuff on it, but I set the task and left it alone and it was done in the morning. The image included here shows Carbon Copy's review page for the performed tasks.CAVIAT: you may need to use a program that allows the computer to work without shutting down after a period of inactivity. I use an app called ""Amphetemine"", which forces the computer to stay on in various circumstances that you can set. I set mine to remain on ""as long as specified app is working"" and chose Carbon Copy Cloner. Not sure you have to do this, but Amphetamine is a great app and I didn't want to take the chance of having to start over, so I used it, and it worked great.The noise some complain about could be other drives (I have the 12 TB version for desktop) or it may be a personal preference, but a drive in a plastic case like this with lots of air holes in it will make some noise, however I didn't find this ""noisy"" at all IMHO.So far, I'm impressed with Carbon Copy as well, but like the drive, I'm in my infancy with using it, so time will tell. I also have a 1 TB external I use for Time Machine, so instead of using this one for that, I will most likely also set up the drive to copy that drive so I have a backup of my Time Machine just in case. You can set Carbon Copy to copy whenever it detects a change in a drive, so once the initial copying is done, the lengthy copies are done, and it's only copying when things change.If you have issues with one of these drives not being recognized by your computer straight out of the box, FIRST make sure you have the correct US plug installed. THEN, make sure to reformat to APFS if you're running Catalina or later if you plan to use it for your Time Machine backups. At that point, so far in my experience, it's a great drive. I'm giving four stars only because of having to hunt down good documentation for the actually necessity for reformatting for the OSs, and for having NO information about the right plug to use. NO idea why the one with holes won't work, but it would be nice if they gave a heads-up on that.Once it's been working a while, I'll readdress this review."
2551,5,"Its a simple plug in and set up, id recommend naming it something you will remember",2TB hard drive that is simple and useful
2552,5,No problems so far,Bought this as en external drive for my ps4. Not exactly on the fast side but I needed a large drive as I have a lot of games and this one does the trick.
2553,1,Trash,Lost all my storage after a couple of months do not buy
2554,5,Working great,Got it to store ps4 and ps5 games.Have had no issues with it
2555,4,works well,It works ok needs better instructions for non geeks like me
2556,1,It died after the return window. So it was a loss,Great price and storage capacity. Died after the return window 😔
2557,2,Not working,"The description says it works for Mac, however it doesn’t work for my iMac or Mac book. It only shows a circle with a line through it."
2558,5,Best External drive ever,Worth the price and love the brand. Better in my opinion than WD external hard drives.
2559,5,Purchased as a gift,Unable to evaluate product because it was purchased as a gift.
2560,5,Super Good,Works very well
2561,5,Great,Works as advertised and now I got 2 extra tbs on my ps4 :)
2562,5,Good Hard drive,Worked well for my DVR.
2563,5,So far so good,Purchased this for our PS4 and so far it’s been working greatly. We plugged it into our PS4 and formatted it to storage. Real simple with no extra hassles. Definitely beats the ones that you pay more just for the PS logo.
2564,1,Poor Choice,I purchased one of these in 4/2021 and another in 1/2022 after the first one failed. The second one failed in 2 months. Working with Seagate to resolve.
2565,1,Item stopped working,It lasted less than three months maximum then HDD stopped working. Useless and I lost all my data now.
2566,1,Extremely slow! - Updated,"I'm using mine for my PS4 games on my PS5 and every single game on the hard drive is loading very slowly on all loading screens, I've had other Seagate hard drives before but I've never had this problem with them. I'm in the process of trying to get it replaced and will update this review if the defective problem is repaired.Update: Purchased in March 2022: I contacted Amazon to replace it thinking it was a faulty hard drive but after the new one came in I tested it side by side compared to my husband who has an older version of the Seagate harddrive and the loading screens took twice as long on each loading screen. I don't know what they did to their product but they definitely ruined it, for video games I say find another hard drive!!"
2567,1,The hard drive failed after a couple of times of using it.,The hard drive failed after a couple of times of using it. My Macbook doesn't recognize the disk anymore. Couldn't recover the data.
2568,5,comes with cable,It does what it needs to do. I haven’t had it long but I’m sure it’ll work just fine.
2569,1,Died within a month,"Got this to hold extra work and art files, but within a month it stopped working, taking ALL the files down with it. Now I gotta pay $150 just to ATTEMPT to retrieve the files. Absolutely devastated, Amazon should be ashamed to make this one of their ""Amazon Choice"" products! Wouldnt be surprised if the good reviews are bots, honestly..."
2570,5,Great little storage device,"Works well, easy to use"
2571,5,It works for ps4 pro,I love it have way more space for my ps4 pro and download basically all the games I want to play
2572,5,"Been using it for years, and its solid & Reliable","I've been using this as my main back up device for all my YouTube videos over 5 years. It's been reliable, and a life saver. I'm so glad I got it."
2573,5,So far,It works great so far!
2574,1,Falsa compatibilidad con Mac,"En la descripción del artículo, garantizan la compatibilidad con Mac, sin embargo, no funciona en la MacBook Pro M1. Adjunto una captura de pantalla que no funciona. Lamentablemente, no puedo hacer la devolución porque estoy fuera de Estados Unidos."
2575,2,Can’t download and play “new” games on new xbox because it needs to be “faster” very disappointing,"If you have new gen don’t bother buying this it will ask u to download “new” games to your internal storage due to external not being fast enough, it’s fine for older games but any new release no luck."
2576,4,Good for all my videos,Video
2577,5,Quality manufacturer,I bought to back up my PC. I works just right for my need.
2578,1,This product is thrash.,Do not buy this product. It was damage and cheap.
2579,3,Good for video/pictures storage but not for PC games,Not good for PC games but good for keeping video/pictures.
2580,5,Great product!,"I was looking for a slim, black portable hard drive and this was the one. Good bye to my bulky ones that are too heavy. I loved how securely it was packaged and also it was easy to work with."
2581,5,very good product,very good product
2582,5,Very happy so far,Everything about this device is good plus it is very fast.
2583,5,Perfect for what I need. (Backup storage),"Great backup drive. I am a graphic artist and use this to periodically back up my PC hard drive to this. So far speeds are good enough, quiet and compact."
2584,3,only 5.45 tb available of the supposed6 tb,only 5.45 tb available of the supposed6 tbgot me onceit will not happen again
2585,5,Works well with logic,Works well with Logic Pro x and storing my project files
2586,5,Great little unit.,I use this unit as the storage on my Tablo DVR. It works flawlessly and dead quietly.
2587,5,Justo como lo pedi,Justo como la queria. No defraudo la compra. Estoy complacido
2588,5,"A ""little bit"" noisy, but great capacity. Not very portable, but it's good to leave it at my desk.","A ""little bit"" noisy, but great capacity. Not very portable, but it's good to leave it at my desk."
2589,4,Pog,"It’s a really good external , all you got to do is to take care of it."
2590,5,Works as should,Bought it for a playstation 4 pro. Its plug and play and so far seems to be performing well.
2591,1,Wouldn't Mount,I backup my hard drives with more and more TBs.I bought this item and it took about a day to backup/copy to.It seem to work just fine for a few days and then one morning I couldn't find the drive on my computer.The drive wasn't mounting.I am being refunded and trying a new one
2592,5,"SOY DE ECUADOR ME LLEGO MUY BIEN, MUCHAS GRACIAS :-)","SOY DE ECUADOR ME LLEGO MUY BIEN, MUCHAS GRACIAS :-)"
2593,1,It crushed within2 months and I lost my data,It crushed in 2 months and I lost all my data and included warranty recovery takes like 3 months
2594,5,great product !!worked perfectly..,love the ease of use !!! Simply amazing product!! Wish i had this years ago.. For any business i strongly recommend !! all my files are backed up and secure. Best product i ever bought on amazon !!
2595,5,It's handy,"Slow-ish transfer rate, can't move it much, and it does the job. Keep liquids away from it obviously"
2596,3,It randomly makes my system crash,It randomly makes my system crash
2597,5,Reliable,Does what it says
2598,3,Good enough,When I went to checkout Amazon said “hey there’s a newer model!” so I landed on this device (I have 3 of the older model) but this does not feel newer at all. It’s high capacity so it does it’s job but it is MUCH louder than the previous model and often barks and squeals even when nothing is being written to the disk.Setup also took much longer and I had to reboot like 6 times for the device to be recognized by Win10 properly.So yeah it works but if your desk is nearby the sound will be annoying. I’ll only order the older model if I need another.
2599,5,Good,The metrials feel a bit cheap and no USB-C connectivity but for the price I guess it's worth it
2600,1,Will Never Buy A Seagate Again,"This is the worst ext hard drive I have ever had. Nothing but problems from the get go. Shows up in device mgr but won't open, says drives are up to date but also says can't find drive etc and on and on. I have never had this many issues with any other brand. I bought 2 of these and they are both the same issues. I could never recommend these to anyone with a straight face."
2601,5,16 TB!!!Awesome!!,"Excellent piece of equipment!!Works great, very happy."
2602,5,"Plug and ""Play!""","It's EASY to use and portable!No software to install, just plug in and use as a portable storage device.Very Nice!"
2603,5,Slows down computer when in use,So far haven’t had any problems than when my desktop is trying to store/transfer to the external hard drive that my computer goes really slow but so far so good…I’ve had it for about 2 months now
2604,1,Crap,It lasted 4 months now its just a paper weight
2605,3,It really IS loud!,"I needed a bigger backup drive, and something affordable. I saw in the reviews for this drive that people complained about how loud it is. I couldn’t imagine it could be louder than a computer fan, so I dismissed it and purchased anyway. Well, everyone is right! This thing ticks and “thinks” NON STOP! I work from home and can hear it going from other rooms and when I wake up. I even have a foam cushion underneath is to keep it from vibrating my desk. I’m starting to consider getting something else, because this is ridiculous!"
2606,5,Great!,"Another winner,I expect this backup HDD will work very well. NOTE: It does NOT come with a bookend stand and must be kept upright for function. Otherwise, a great value!"
2607,5,Good,"60 bucks,can't beat it"
2608,5,Seamless Replacement for 5TB Device,"I skipped a Tech Support rating because, like the prior drive I have experienced absolutely no need to contact them.I have used the predecessor drive for several years for backups. I unplug it - except when making backups. As it is an on-going practice, when it filled, it was time to get a new drive. I replaced the drive and all cables with absolutely no blip in performance.Yes, I have some cloud backups... but I feel much better having direct control of this function."
2609,5,Love it,"Fits all my needs, easy set up, easy use"
2610,5,A Must Have,Great Value for the price
2611,5,I like it so far,I bought it for backups.
2612,5,Backs up my old cpu with no issues,"I had an old compact Seagate external HD that recently bit the dust so I immediately ordered this one. Easy to install, backed up everything quickly, and has plenty of space. Very easy. Gives me peace of mind that everything is backed up in case my cpu hard drive dies."
2613,4,it doesn't work like the description,"I bought it to save docs from an HP and a MAC, I successfully saved the HP docs (easy) but on MAC it only reads, I can't store or retrieve anything from it.And for the registration, I always get a message saying: There is a problem connecting to the Seagate registration server. Please try again later. And I tried several times and nothing. Not happy with it so far.UPDATE:In the description it says it works with both, and It did work perfect with my HP as described but you have to actually FORMAT it to work with MAC.. after this it does work with both perfect...so far :)"
2614,5,Powerful and easy to install for my PS4,"This device carries a ton of space for the money. I use it for the PS4, and it was plugged in and holding 15 games in the first 20 minutes. Very small and sleek. I highly recommend it."
2615,3,didn't work for me,"I cannot say this device is ineffective for people in general, only that it caused my entire computer to freeze up when I connected it.My mouse would not work, I had no choice but to do a hard ""shut down"".I tried it again with the same results.It could have been a bad match between my needs & the device.. Idon't know.But 2 x was enough for me..sent it back.Thank goodness for Amazon's good return policy !"
2616,5,Very good product,Arrived on time.Product as described.Easy setup.Good quality.
2617,5,Excellent hard drive,Fantastic product. Arrived on time. I'm a photographer and this is an excellent way to keep photos and videos and not have to keep everything on my computer.
2618,5,Smooth sailing,Tons of space so glad I bought it. I had doubts but it's actually great
2619,1,Returned 2 hard drives - neither worked,"I mailed a second hard drive back, neither could be recognized by my Mac. I have not gotten confirmation of the 2nd return. Please acknowledge."
2620,1,It deleted all my files,I do not recommend if you’re using for serious projects!Deleted all my files and tech support was no Help. I went local tech support and said it would cost up to $1000 to restore
2621,1,Garbage....,Freezes all the time. Won't allow me to copy files. This thing is junk. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
2622,5,Good Buy,Happy with purchase
2623,1,Shouldn't have bought it.,The drive didn't work after the first month of saving all my files. This has happened for the 2nd time. I purchased this same product twice. Bad product.
2624,1,DIED AFTER LESS THAN 2 YEARS,Will never buy a seagate drive again. This was used only for media storage and died after 20 months. Just sat on a desk and was never moved. Seagate=trash
2625,2,No Packaging??,"This product (supposedly 'New') came in an open plastic package, that was blank with no label.It seems as if someone opened the original packaging, lost the outer packaging, and then just resold the product with only the internal packaging.Not cool at all.It seems to function properly for now, which is the only reason why it's getting a second star."
2626,5,Good portable drive,Good
2627,1,Not for ps4,states it is compatible with the ps4 plugged it in and said not supported.False advertising
2628,5,Sleek design,This hard drive was very easy to format to my PlayStation and I’ve already downloaded over 20 games and counting. Best deal for a 2T I could find on Amazon.
2629,5,Awesome,Works well on Xbox 1
2630,5,Quick Access to Files with Sharp Edges,"If you own a Mac as I do, you'll need to reformat this drive in order to use it as storage.It was a quick process and since then it's been a great product.I was able to access larger files with ease and quick!Couldn't be happier!!!Side note, just be careful of the edges and corners because they are extremely sharp.I didn't see this as a negative thing because it doesn't bug me as it is just a portable drive that just sits on my desk.But if you're using it on the go, this might not be the best drive for you.I believe Seagate also make a more portable 8T drive."
2631,5,Muy contento con el producto,Es súper ligero Y el precio es muy bueno para la capacidad
2632,4,Can't use for playstation.,Amazon should change what its used for because it does not work for playstation so only get it if your gonna use it for your Mac or pc.
2633,1,Deceptive claims,"I purchased the so-called 16TB drive.But when plugged in, my PC says the capacity is 14.5TB.I understand a few GB being missing from the capacity for various reasons.But missing a full 1.5TB.You have got to be kidding.So I contacted Seagate, and they sent me a document showing how their drives, including the one I bought, have less capacity on PCs than they do on MACs.And it does show the 16TB will have only 14.5TB on other than MAC computers.But understand this.As of 12/31/2021, 74% of the market is PCs, 15% is MAC, and the remaining 11% is miscellaneous, which most likely also show the capacity as only 14.5TB.So, don't you think it's misleading advertising to claim 16TB when that will only be the case on 15% of computers?There is no question that Seagate knows this and is hiding the fact.All they'd have to do is have some sort of disclaimer or caveat regarding this – that MACs will show 16TB but other systems may show 14.5TB.And obviously they receive this complaint routinely, otherwise they would not have bothered to create a document to try to explain this.Truth in advertising?Not for Seagate, that's for sure."
2634,5,So simple,Quick and easy to use right out of the box.Fast too
2635,5,Great for Xbox,I mainly use this to transfer games.
2636,5,Great product at a fair price,Massive storage in a small footprint.Easy to use - plug and play!
2637,4,"Haven't had it long, but seems to be just what I need",Had no idea my new little laptop would run out of storage so soon. This external hard drive seems to be the answer.
2638,2,won't partition on Mac,"I've followed all the directions from SeaGate and from Apple. This drive cannot be partitioned on Mac OS. I have correctly formatted it for Mac OS Extended-Journaled and it works fine as a drive, but I wanted it to have two partitions and that's simply not possible. This limitation wasn't clear to me when I bought the drive. I would have chosen a different product if I knew the Mac compatibility was so limited."
2639,5,Highly recommend,"Super fast file transfers, very happy"
2640,1,Knock it over & it's toast,"This was the 2nd external hard drive I've purchased from Seagate. I should have learned my lesson with the first one. The same thing happened with both of them - while it was backing up my system, I accidently bumped them; they fell over & 'boom' - they both became worthless pieces of trash. Unrecognizable to any computer. All of my data became unrecoverable. And of course, it was past the warranty. So frustrating. Get a solid state external drive. Seagate - never again."
2641,5,Perfectly interacted with a Xbox One S,Was seamless. I have been adding storage to a Xbox (360 and One) since Microsoft let us do it. I have never had such a painless and easy job. Well doneSeagate!
2642,1,Dead within months,"An absolute turd of a hard drive.Not only did it write horrendously slow, but the drive became inaccessible four months after purchase.It shows the drive as accessible, but will not open no matter how long you wait.This drive is a complete waste of money unless you want a 100 dollar paperweight."
2643,5,Well worth the money,"This product was purchased as external hard drive for my Xbox One. It has performed extremely well storing all my apps and games. I use it for my gaming, my youtube tv, and my amazon music with no issues. It is well worth the money and I highly recommend this product."
2644,5,Small in size but large in storage capacity,"This portable hard drive is so nice. It's so small, light weight, and easy to store, yet it has a huge storage capacity. Using it for my wedding photos :)"
2645,5,Windows and Linux,"Works great in both Windows and Linux, just plug it in."
2646,5,Simple to use,I use with Mac Time Machine for my MacBook Pro
2647,5,Excellent product and customer service,"Seagate was so helpful correcting a faulty drive issue and terrific from start to finish. I purchased an external drive, and the drive did not show up in file explorer. It crashed which happens with hardware. I keep files in the cloud, so it wasn't an issue.I did want the drive replaced, so I called customer service and they were wonderful! The rep was knowledgeable, told me I had a warranty (I didn't know I had one), could return the drive for a new one, and even sent me a prepaid mailing label! He told me they would try to retrieve my data and he couldn't guarantee a successful recovery. The drive was back within 2-1/2 weeks with all my files recovered!I also didn't know the drive they sent me was a temporary backup and was surprised when I received a brand-new drive in the mail. It's working perfectly. The file transfer speed is excellent for an HD. It measures 3""x5""x1"" so you can throw it into a pocket or purse. All-in-all, a 10*+ rating.I was not reimbursed for this review :) Definitely recommend."
2648,5,Great Thanks!,Great Thanks!
2649,5,Holds MANY games!,Very durable and holds many games! Surprised me at how many games I can download to this
2650,4,Good quality,I needed a hard drive to store my files and this was a good price for the amount of storage. I use Mac so after formatting it was ready use. The only thing is it makes a sound when inside but it doesn’t bother me that much. Overall pretty solid.
2651,4,great to store information,easy to use and safe
2652,4,Must reformat it for MAC,Go to disk utility and erase-rename & change to exfat to get it to work for your MacBook
2653,5,Honest review here.,Got mine. Works great. Has some stuff already inside and not sure why its in there. Havent had to use tech support. But overall thing works great. Definetly thankful for it.
2654,1,"Failed after one month, never moved",This drive lasted a month before I started hearing clicking. Now it won't mount. Didn't even get everything transferred over. It never left my desk so it's not like it got knocked. Now I have to figure out warranty support through Seagate. What a waste. Never again.
2655,1,Disappointing,Died after a year and a half. Precisely NOT what it was purchased to do.
2656,3,The connecting cable is too short.,The connection cable is too short. It should be at least 12 inches long. I have to put it on top of my laptop to use it where I sit. Or I can rest it on the arm of the chair.
2657,5,Love it,Easy
2658,1,crashed within 8 months of use,"Luckily, I was only using for a time machine backup.I saw others reported disk failure before I ordered and took the risk anyways.I called Seagate and they are happy to replace the item, but only if I return the old drive.Do not do this people!Seagate cannot guarantee that all their employees or third parties follow thier confidentiality policies.You never know if your data will be recovered!"
2659,4,NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE,IT DOESN'T SEEMS TO WORK ON 2.0 TO WELL AND IT IS NOT 3.1 SO TRANSFER SPEEDS ARE VERY SLOW!
2660,1,"Doesn't work, and couldn't resolve with customer support","After following all of the (very poorly written) online support documentation, and spending an hour working with one of their customer support reps, I was never able to upload files to this hard drive. Got back my money but can't get back my time, don't waste yours."
2661,5,Great,Worth the money.
2662,5,Does everything well,Purchased to hold my karaoke software and the speed and performance are top notch.
2663,5,Lots of storage for the price. Great deal!,"With all the music, photos and videos I have accumulated over the years I’ve replaced my 3Tb WD MyCloud (company has discontinued its service) to this 5Tb which will last me a good long time. The price is well worth it. I only wish it was smaller but hey, it’s 5Tb!"
2664,5,Great Hard Drive!,I have always use this brand for my hard drives. my first one is still going strong that i bought back in 2013. needing more and more space I will just buy more storage so this is my 4th hard drive and they are easy to use and don’t freeze up like I have seen with other brands
2665,5,Plenty of space,I'm using this to get all the data for my ps4 games all in one drive. But i hate that 400 gigs disappear to run the software. So 5.0 tb. Turns to 4.6 tb of space right out of the box.
2666,5,It dont get no better,"Smaller then your cellphone,this thing is easily portable. If thats what you want.Mine sets on top of the tower automatically backing up my files on a weekly basis leaving me worry free."
2667,5,Looks great,Perfect add on for my ps4 pro
2668,1,Worst Purchase,"All my data is gone. I took it to a store to fix it but it is super expensive to be fixed and very difficult too. and I called the service, they asked me to ship it to a lab in Netherlands. Don’t buy it to store valuable data."
2669,5,Worth it!,"Got this and was amazed at the size of the box. It's very small, I expected more haha but this product works amazing. Easy to set up and I actually like how small it is. Makes fitting it anywhere easy."
2670,1,Wouldn’t recommend,"Ordered this product and didn’t work, returned and ordered again.The second one didn’t work either with my MacBook.Seemed like a knockoff product."
2671,5,Great hard drive,I have a 500 GB PS4 so this was the perfect solution to adding extra space for all of the huge games they keep releasing and their enormous updates.
2672,5,PS5 compatible,"You can download all the games you want, and you just plug it into the back of your ps5."
2673,1,Worked for 3 months and died,"Product worked great for 3 months.Then - out of the blue - it died, and I lost all the data on it.Will never buy a Seagate product again.Pure trash.Extremely disappointed."
2674,5,Works well,Seems fine
2675,5,Works just like it should it is the second one I have,Works just like it should it is the second one I have
2676,5,Tons of space,I plugged it into my Xbox which used to hold maybe 6 games but now I have 49 currently download and 19 queued with only 37.4% space used. Only downside is that you combat have games and other files like pictures or music due to the way games are formatted but this is not seagates fault.
2677,1,SCAM!,"Sadly, I just now opened my external hard drive because I had not needed it immediately when I purchased it last year... to my dismay :( it was literally a bag of ROCKS in the package when I opened it! WOW! This is a 1st for me after YEARS of purchases on Amazon! Buyer BEWARE!!!! Unfortunately for me, it I am outside of the return window! Would love my $100 back!!!!"
2678,5,Capacity,Wants to keep cutting out every once in a while.
2679,5,Works well,I use it to copy video’s that I edit at the local cable access so I can load to YouTube. Their equipment in a all Mac and mine is windows. I works great with no hiccups. I will definitely buy again
2680,5,Easy to Use,Easy to use.So far very reliable.
2681,1,Defective unit,"I sent this back and replaced it with a 4TB that works great. This one sounded horrible, like the trash truck coming down the street."
2682,3,Not a good fit for me,"This HDD has loads of storage for my Xbox Series S, but it feels flimsily built (I can feel knocking inside of it when I rest my hand on it from the platters spinning and the casing feels paper thin), is always warm to the touch, and you can feel the platters knocking about inside. It seems like it'll be prone to failure any minute. I've returned this and bought the official Xbox endorsed Seagate 8TB external HDD with USB ports on the front and am MUCH more pleased with that purchase."
2683,4,Did not come in a box or other useful packaging.,"The drive is fine, but we purchased it for backup and did not realize it would only come in a thin plastic bag.We expected it to arrive in a box that would protect it during storage.Not happy about that."
2684,3,Gaming,Purchased for my xbox series s and sadly it's not fast enough for all the games to be played off the hdd
2685,5,Great product,"Great storage, easy to use"
2686,1,I've bought 8 of these. 5 Five FIVE have failed. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!,"Okay, for the price, these seem like they're a great buy. Don't. I've had 5 out of 8 die. These will fail for the slightest amount of movement. They are delicate like a new born babies behind. I may be giving up Seagate drives all together after these purchases!"
2687,5,Finally something that works,"I had bought some external drived in the past hoping to expand my storage, but they either wouldn't work or weren't compatible like they were supposed to be. I took yet another leap of faith on this one. So glad I did. It actually has the storage promised and it is quite small and portable."
2688,5,Good Item,"We use this to backup all of our laptops, tablets, and phones.It came formated and is used on Winfows 10.Don't mind the 0 of 5 stars for technical support.I would leave a rating for that, if it worked poorly enough for me to call technical support.To all the simple rating men like me.Good item.Buy it."
2689,5,Mega storage,Good for heavy gamers or just storing a ton of apps is the way to go
2690,4,Great probable drive.,Great probable drive.
2691,5,"Good product, good price","Good product, good price"
2692,1,Dont buy this product,"The drive arrived dead on arrival. It also had no instructions whatsoever. I thought it was easy enough to install; I selected the proper power lead (the US, Europe, and the like). I plugged in the connection cable between the computer and drive, and nothing. I am deeply disappointed with the product."
2693,5,Great product,Just what I was expecting
2694,1,Not sure how to make it compatible with Mac,This product doesn't work with Mac..
2695,5,Works good,So far so good..no problems as of right now
2696,3,I bought the 14tb...two of them audible clicks?,"The media could not be loaded. I bought the 14tb, I can hear it working, sounds like a deep quick repeated click when writing, is that normal? This is my second one now as I sent back the first one concerned but the second has the same sound. It's a little more audible on start up, but here is a video with the writing sounds."
2697,5,all good,works perfectly
2698,2,14.5 TB,"ESTE DISCO DURO APARECE EN LA PAGINA DE AMAZON CON 16 TB, PERO REALMENTE CUANDO LO CONECTAS A LA COMPUTADORA SOLO SON 14.5 TB, PIENSO QUE ESO ES PUBLICIDAD ENGAÑOSA."
2699,5,It works,It does what it's supposed to.
2700,1,Not good,i just got it and i connected it to my computer it makes beep sounds and it wont connect while my other one works..
2701,5,You get for what you pay for,"This external hardrive is definitely buggy. I have issues with it staying connected to the Xbox and everytime you restart your Xbox you must unplug it and plug it back in for it to work again. Not to mention, the last one that I had short circuited and I lost all my data and games on it"
2702,1,I cannot use it on my Mac,It keeps asking for a decryptionpassword and is jot whiny recongnized by then machine
2703,5,Versátil. Excelente inversión,Máximo almacenamiento por poco dinero
2704,5,Nice product,Much better than WD products - I had 8 WD disk die on me at a Microsoft update that occurred during a multi-disk backup operation (Microsoft forces update with no concern what happens in your system at the time).
2705,5,Saved my PC,"My PC was running low on storage, and this hard drive saved my life. I never have to worry about storage with the 1 TB storage. AND its just as simple as plugging in the USB. No need for going into your computer and installing new hardware. 10/10 nice and simple product, that serves it's purpose perfectly."
2706,5,It works and you cant beat the price,look just dont overheat the beast and it will work great for years have 2 one sent to my friends xbox one on my ps4 and they both work great. Now for computers you can find better but i still give this 5stars for a console 2 tb
2707,5,Best bang for the buck,Fast and relatively cheap
2708,5,Its 4.5 tb not 5 TB that being said...,While this hdd is fast and very reliable I was disappointed to see it was actually 4.5tb. I thought it would be 4.8 as 99% hdd's are never as described when it comes to the actual space but this was way less than that. 300gb less which is a lot. On the bright side i got pretty cheap for the size and speed and it works very well which is why even with my disappointment on the size I'm giving it 5 stars.
2709,4,good,its ok
2710,1,Absolutely useless,"Isn't USB 3.0. Incompatible with everything I have, and wont even function on 2.0 USB. A useless piece of plastic."
2711,5,Me encanta,"Es bueno, económico, rápido, ligero, portable. Perfecto. Feliz con mi compra."
2712,1,Doesn't last,"Do not store valuable information on this. It is not reliable, used about 10 times and failed just beeps and does not work"
2713,5,Great,"Easy to hook up, simple to use, A NO BRAINER!!!"
2714,5,Works perfectly,Gives me so much needed space for my PlayStation 4. Definitely recommend if you’re having the same problem I had.
2715,1,This device did not work,I purchased this device last August and went to use it recently. It was defective.
2716,4,Solid and Stable,Works perfect with solid build though it reads 4.6 TB only in storage
2717,5,Good,Dj
2718,4,Just a massive USB-C External HDD,It is a little bit loud and has a significant vibration.
2719,1,Drive failed after 19 months; Seagate website says warranty expired after 14 months.,"This is the shortest lasting hard drive I've ever bought. For what these go for, this feels like a total rip-off."
2720,5,A+,"great price, works wonderfully. came packaged well."
2721,5,Great external hard drive,This thing works amazingly to add storage on my ps5
2722,1,Very disappointed.,"I got this hard drive straight out of the box, plugged it in, & nothing.The light comes on but my computer only recognized it for a second, then the icon was gone & it has never reappeared.Waste of money."
2723,5,Great product,My kids loved these. It gave them the option to have more saved games and other things on the systems.
2724,1,don't buy this,"Don't buy this. I am not tech savvy, but I have used other back up hard drives in the past and they were much easier to use. Can't believe this has as good of reviews it does."
2725,5,Nice,Good size
2726,4,1.84TBs,"While the unit works perfectly, the capacity is not a full 2TB, it is 1.84TBs"
2727,1,Both drives failed,Both drives failed. One failed within a few days and the other failed within a few months. Horrible drives.
2728,1,Horrible drive!,"NOTHING like the sea gate drive I had for my Playstation that died. This one needs to be formatted and I don’t do computers, so this will be returned as it’s NOT the drive it says! My previous drive and the one for my sons playstation we plugged it in and it worked no formatting. My laptop doesn’t do fat32 just exfat and I’m not downloading stuff!!!!"
2729,5,Great,More then enough storage
2730,2,MAC Not really,This is not out-of-box Mac compatible. You will have to set it up to run with MaOS.Set up is not easy.
2731,5,Works as advertised,"I have used Seagate for years, the storage capacity is amazing on this unit."
2732,1,GARBAGE. Unusable after one month.,"I should have read the reviews. This writes INCREDIBLY slow, it's painful. I have tried to back up my 500 GB hard drive twice now using Time Machine, and it took at least 12 hours. Then, after both times, my computer tells me that the disk is unusable and I need to reformat and start again. I could hear a giant clicking as it spun, the likes of which I haven't heard since my generation 3 ipod."
2733,5,Worked great for us,"I only did 3 stars for tech support since honestly I have needed to call or deal with them,it works great."
2734,1,Barely Works,"I've had plenty of HDDs before, but this one is the worst. Touching it or moving the computer will cause it to fail."
2735,1,crash in 5 months time/no link for the free 1 year recovery,We have only had this for 5 months and it crashed.It says that there is a one year recovery but there is no link to click into to do this. I finally found the link after much searching and sent it in.Heard back 3 months later and they are unable to recover. I have lost several drone footages that were very important to me.I will never buy this product again!
2736,5,Takes a little Time to Determine,"So far, I have no complaints. The external drive works fine. I use it to back up my computer.The back-up worked fine because I upgraded the operating system on my Mac desktop. I have backed up two times so far in the last month. I currently have no issues. I will see in 6 months."
2737,1,"don't hold your breath for the 1-year ""rescue"" !","It took Seagate 2+years from the time I first asked for the rescue/recovery, including about a DOZEN requests from me, including to Seagate management. Never again."
2738,1,I would give this a zero if I could,"It says this is supported by PlayStation. I ordered it surgically for playstation, low and behold, it's not supported. Now I'm out the money I spent and have a hard drive I can't even use."
2739,5,Great Device,"I had a similiar drive from this vendor, and I was so impressed by their tech support (and software) that it was a no-brainer to order from this vendor again.The ONLY thing that gave me a little bit of difficulty was the PLUG, the power plug. I wish that it didn't have a huge BOX on it, because that makes it nearly impossible to plug into a power strip of ANY shape or size.It should look like a laptop charger. Small plug into the power-strip, and then the convertor in the middle, and then the small port that plugs into the disk drive. #CHEERS"
2740,5,Good value plenty of storage.,"This is a good value for a traditional hard drive.I use it as a utility drive for temp storage.I would never use an external HDD (non-SSD) for storing files I routinely access, but this was a great value for a huge amount of storage for utilitarian/occassional tasks."
2741,5,Very nice and very fast,Good for fast backups
2742,5,works with my mac,I am getting another one to use with the pc's. My mac has 3 already
2743,5,Great product keep up the good work,Great product keep up the good work works just fine
2744,5,Just what I needed,Works as expected for what I needed it for.
2745,4,Seems good so far,When I first started it was missing over 250 gig of storage space which pissed me off a bit. If you advertise it’s 2T storage then it should have space for 2T. If it needs 200G for formatting then make it so it holds 2.2T. It was frustrating at first because some games needed to be on the Xbox main hard drive and couldn’t go on external devices (speed issue I think). However the games were easy to move around and besides the fact that it’s short a couple hundred gig it is working very well.
2746,3,Linux users beware,"It works well with Windows, however, I got this as a gift for my girlfriend who uses Linux and wanted to be able to have an encrypted backup. Failure after failure from writing files to unmounting the drive. Going to have to buy her a new one as we've already sent it out to the manufacturer and received a replacement. Very disappointed."
2747,1,"""Cricket"" sounds coming from hard drive; imminent failure?","I bought this drive in June, and by February of the next year (8 months later), it started making ""cricket"" sounds. I did a search online for what that means. Most articles I read say it's because the drive is failing.Just after the sounds started -- while I was looking up the information -- the drive disconnected from the computer by itself, and wouldn't reconnect properly.Hope it still works because there are lots of important business files on that drive. I'm thinking of just using smaller flash cards, instead of hard drives, moving forward."
2748,5,EZ,"Small, powerful, compact"
2749,2,worked for7 months.,trying to get help with 1-year rescue service. kept losing connection with them after starting trouble shooting the problem. nothing helped to this point.
2750,1,NOT for Mac!,"This would not work. When I clicked on ""Start Here for Mac"", or something like that, it gave me an error message. I called Seagate and was on hold for 30 minutes, gave up, called amazon, got a nice guy and HE called seagate. He couldn't figure it out either. We gave up and I returned it."
2751,5,Nice write and read,"I dont know the exact specs, but I had an old Seagate external drive for 1 TB that ran super slowly and had trouble writing at all sometimes. I dont blame it, I had it for about a decade and it went through a few moves so probably got a little banged up. Well, I got this one a few months ago and am thoroughly impressed. The write and read is pretty decent and the storage is just what I need for games! Updates that used to take me hours now take a maximum of 25 minutes (thats for genshin! Anyone who has had to update that game understands how life changing this is.)Now I just need some other components that can keep up, too haha."
2752,2,Stopped working a little over one year after purchase,"Seagate is very lucky for that 2nd star because for that first year, no issues. Bought this 02/03/2021 and it only ever was hooked up to a single PC and never was moved save when picking up the little guy to clean around the table it and the pc were on. I used it primarily to save family photos, or game files of ONLY Skyrim. About a week ago it began to make a small beep sound every second and the computer doesn't recognize it. I've attempted to contact Seagate customer support but their IVR is...well it's subpar at best and I was tired of it kicking me off. I could go to a local computer repair store to see if the files can be recovered but that's an estimated 30.00 to investigate the condition of the files, another possible 150.00 to do the deed, and then I'd have to have another external hard drive to store those files. I don't have that kind of money.It's one thing if the hard drive goes after several years of hard use. But after barely more than a single year?"
2753,5,great,Delivered on time & working perfect
2754,5,Ordered a 2TB and only got a 1TB (twice),I order this on two separate occasions and just noticed that both of them are only 1TB when I had ordered 2TB. It’s too late to do anything now so I’ll just deal with it. Great product and I’m sure support would be just as good but I’m not messing with it.
2755,3,USB 3.0 interacts negatively with Xbox,Get an extension cable for the usb 3.0 and move the storage device far away from the console. Will cause your controller to disconnect and headset to freak out.
2756,1,Maybe I got a lemon,Drive lasted 3 days.Could not access data on drive after just 3 days of use.Probably had only about 5gb on it when it gave up the ghost.Opted for something else after returning it.Just glad it failed right away and not after I had a bunch of data on it.
2757,2,3 months old and glitchy,"I have only had this for 3 months, and it is already glitchy.I always do the ""safely remove hardware and eject media"" before manually removing the portable hard drive, yet lately it is being weird... Even though I have no more documents opened, I saved everything and I have done the safety step. It would still say unable to remove due to running applications etc. Occasionally, I couldn't save documents because it says ""The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error."" Is there a live update that this device needs that I am not aware off? I don't know how else it would be glitchy. It has enough memory left, I do the safety checks and it is still glitchy. So I don't know. I would check other hard drives if you are looking for one."
2758,4,quick and easy setup - not 14T,"Quick setup and easy to use, but only registers a little over 12T, not 14T as sold and advertized."
2759,1,Doesn’t function at all,"Lost the first terabyte of data after disconnecting from a tv. Gave up on recovering the data and am attempting to transfer data from one hard drive to the seagate and my computer keeps giving me an error code that it can’t locate the drive. Don’t buy as it neither transfers or stores data, which are pretty integral to any storage device."
2760,1,Will not work for next gen consoles,This will not work with ps5 or Xbox series s. Still makes you move games from main HD to external and back if you wanna play.
2761,5,Work,Good
2762,5,A must needed item!!!,"We have had another external hard drive, it failed and we lost over 10 years of pictures!!! I bought this one and it is still working fine. We have tons of photos on it and other important documents!!! I would recommend this product if you want to store important documents and photos."
2763,5,Funciona sin problema con el PS4. Muy fácil de utilizar y robusto,Es un disco duro de buena calidad y muy fácil de poner a funcionar. Resuelve la necesidad que tenia perfectamente.
2764,5,Works great,Is a good addition to my ps4 works great have only had it for 2 months but no problems.
2765,1,Beeping and Not Recognized By Any Devices,"I bought this for my Xbox Series S. I took it out of its box, and as soon as I plugged it in, it started beeping and the Xbox wouldn’t recognize it.Plugged it into a different port, restarted my Xbox, plugged into my laptop… Wasn’t recognized by any device and it kept beeping.Returned it the same day it was delivered…"
2766,5,Very good,Very good totally recommend
2767,5,Great buy!,Exactly what my son needed for his Xbox was a bit pricey but worth it. I like how he can take it on and off so easy
2768,1,Do not buy if using for IPAD PRO,"I will upgrade my ratings once the devices connects to my iPad pro. It will connect to my Work computer but I need it for my iPad Pro.Update On March 11, 2022This device is Read Only on my IPad Pro which does me no good. A waste of money!"
2769,5,disco duro externo seagate 2t,Excelente igual que otras unidades anteriores que he comprado de la misma marca. Muy buenos y recomendables.Excellent just like other previous units that I have bought from the same brand. Very good and recommended.
2770,5,Exactly what my son wanted!,Came quickly!My son loves it!
2771,3,Confusion on Mac/Win set up,"Pros - good cost to memory available, Seagate name had been reliable in the past, small size, transfer speeds seemed good, relatively quiet, does not seem overly warm in useCons - registration forced to get to web site for drive formatting, poor charts and information on setting up drive for Mac/Win use, 2 paper products included were worthless and a waste of resources, case does not have weight/durable feel (seems fragile) of previous Seagate products, cable is stiffUnknowns - longevity/failure due to the cheap feel of the drive I have long-term worries about reliability.I am going to back up my back ups.As a novice user I shouldn't have to read conflicting review guidance, Apple web site and Seagate robot support to make a drive formatting decision.Apple has made sure file management and storage is a miserable experience."
2772,1,Doesn’t work,This product is either terrible or a scam? This item says it’s compatible with Mac but the first one I ordered said the Mac startup file was corrupt so I couldn’t drag any files into the hard drive. I thought it was a one off error so I returned in exchange for the same item and the second one has the same issue. I tried all the trouble shooting suggestions but it does not work at all. Waste of money
2773,4,If on Xbox or ps restart your system,Good more inscription
2774,1,Heads locked up!,I bought this for my son to use with his XBox and it began making the click of death after 1.5 years.Sadly the heads locked up.Junk!
2775,5,Great portable HD,Compact size and don’t need another plug in!
2776,5,Good,Good
2777,2,No support,Does not always turn on.Called support several times. Phone always disconnected.
2778,5,Perfect for my use,This device is great for transferring data and. Backup.
2779,5,Llego a tiempo,Buen producto
2780,5,"Compact, excellent buy.","Plug and play, not issues."
2781,5,Good product,Great value for money but before I used it I had to make sure it was formatted to the NTFS
2782,1,Completely failed in less than a week,The device had intermittent problems on arrival and failed completely in less than a week.
2783,4,READ IF YOU'RE GETTING SLOW SPEEDS!!!,"When I first got this drive (from an online photo store) it was super slow at only 39MB/s. To top it off the things keep locking up, freezing itself, file explorer, and sometimes the computer itself. After digging around and doing research for hours I came up empty. After opening up a hard driver partition edditing program I saw that the drive had a ""MSR"" partition. Since ""MSR"" is non essential for storage drive, I decided to get delete it to see if it did anything. Afterall I was using a program that would recover partitions so what did I have to lose? Well nothing so far! The drive went from 39MB/s to 139MB/s seq writes after deleting the ""MSR"" Partition! What an incredible difference and change. Can't believe that they would put that on there in the first place. I've heard some reviews stating that the drive is fine, and others saying that it's slow. Perhaps someone at the factory doesn't know what they're doing and are accidentally putting the extra partition on during they're shift as opposed to the other worker that does it right. Or maybe it's a per run thing; but either way that partition should not be on there, and is hindering performance by over 300%.This is now one of my faster externals, even for being a SMR."
2784,1,Piece of garbage,Lasts about a month then decides to stop working then the return window lasts a month and I'm stuck with a 64 dollar piece of garbage and this is the second one that I have bought.
2785,5,My Go-to Portable HDD.,"This is my 3rd purchase. All of them are works as it shoud be. Fast & Smooth connection, No glitch, My First purchased one is still works good and I bought it 4 years ago. Good HDD."
2786,3,HD failed after 3 years,This HD failed after 3 years and i have two other friends with the same 4TB HD that said theirs recently failed as well. very disappointing
2787,5,Good quality external drive.,I'm happy with the product. There's more capacity than I'll probably ever need.Registration link is on the hardrive.It took two calls for support on how to set up the drive with Windows 10.Support was friendly and helpful.
2788,1,REALLY REALLY SLOW,How do you even make a hard drive this slow in this day and age?
2789,3,Decent Value,"Only complaint is that on the Series S, it says newer games need faster storage. So to play some games like Madden or Halo, I have to move the file from the hard driveto the internal hard drive. If that’s a deal breaker, spend the extra money and get the Microsoft expansion card"
2790,5,Buen,Bien
2791,5,Fast Speed,"I recently bought a drone and the video I've been downloading rapidly filled up the drive on my laptop.My computer was starting to run a bit slower and I realized I had all this video I would be better off storing off the main drive.I've been told to buy a solid state drive but for the price and capacity of this drive, it was hard to pass up.Plug it in and it's ready to go.Best of all is the speed!Friends told me to expect several hours to transfer data but I was able to transfer half a terabyte in under an hour.It was surprisingly fast.Now when I work on a video, I can do the work on the computer and when finished, transfer all the files to the external drive.I probably should have done this a long time ago but highly recommend getting an external drive and this Seagate drive is amazing!"
2792,3,No Go with Chromebook,"Didn't work on either of the Chromebooks I have. Chrome didn't recognize the drive at all, but the drive's light did come on and eventually started flashing. I have other portable external, large-capacity drives that the Chromebooks have no issues with. I then tested on one, new Windows 10 and two Windows 7 machines. It functioned correctly on all three as expected. Thus, I must conclude this drive is non-functional with Chromebooks.Seagate phone support answered promptly and was surprised it didn't work with Chrome, suggesting it might be faulty snd to return it. Probably will since the intention was to use it on the Chromebooks.If you are reading this, I suggest you enter Amazon's inventory system by way of the ""Chromebook Compatible Accessories"" link. I should have done so because none of Seagate's products are listed there, which, frankly surprises me since Seagate has been around since the Computer Stone Age. Please get with it Seagate!"
2793,1,Junk drive,Did a back up of all of my albums which took half of a day. Went to plug it in today to find a few pics and it's a dead drive. Waste of money. I'm fuming.
2794,5,awesome device,"does what it’s supposed to do , came in clutch too."
2795,5,If You need a Backup This is the one!,"I bought an Seagate Expansion Hard Drive that was 4tb, that wasn't quite enough but, now that I have the 6tb Seagate HD. This one is just right, it's compatible with all of my Galaxy Devices, my Samsung Smart Monitor and My Samsung Galaxy Books."
2796,2,"Not original packaging, old model","It functions as a hard drive, but I ordered this because my last one died. The factory warranty is supposed to 3 years but I was sent an old model from 2021 that only has 1 year of warranty remaining, and knowing that they only last a few years, receiving an old model which came in generic packaging has me very disappointed."
2797,5,LOVE IT!,"I store all of my games on here for my laptop, definitely is a lifesaver and I highly recommend!"
2798,5,Lifesaver,I ran out of space on my ps4 but this came in clutch so I can play all of my games
2799,5,Worked like a charm!,Didn’t need me to be a geek to know what to do
2800,1,Didn't work for me.,
2801,5,It works well!,My friend helped set up for me.
2802,5,Great,Great
2803,5,lo mejor,funsiona muy ien y es veradderamente una ayuda es bonito ligero y no ocupa mucho espacio
2804,3,Drive failed on 3rd use.,"I wanted to love this EHD. I bought it and began using it right away. Sadly the 3rd time I plugged it in, it began beeping and my computer didn’t recognize that there was a drive plugged in. I contacted Seagate today, I now have an open data recovery claim filed. It will take up to 6 weeks to get a new drive. There is no guarantee they will be able to recover the nearly 1 Tb of data I loaded on it over the weekend. Customer service was very helpful, but a drive shouldn’t die less than a month after purchase."
2805,4,Storage for OTA DVR,It functions as designed
2806,2,This doesnt store PS5 games,Although it is listed as an external hard drive for PS5it will only store PS4 games.we didn't realize it until after the return date because we didn't need it yet.Very disappointing.
2807,1,DO NOT ORDER THIS DRIVE,"I had this thing for two months, and used it ONCE before it stopped working!! My computer never detects it now unless I unplug and plug it in repeatedly. Do not use this to store your personal info and important things on, you'll never be able to access it again or transfer new files onto it! 0 reliability. And when I tried to get a refund, they wouldn't give me one because the ""return window was closed."" They couldn't even get me a replacement. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this drive from Seagate. I'm out $60 bucks now. :("
2808,5,Works as it should,Using this as storage for a laptop with a 256Gb hard drive. Works as expected.
2809,5,As advertised...,Plugged in and it worked like a charm!
2810,5,"Works just fine for PC gaming - BTW/FYI, frailty is the nature of the beast with ext. hard drives...","Got the 1TB version in order to make up for my otherwise powerful gaming laptop's pitiful amount of storage. It works exactly as it should and have been gaming with zero issues. I'm not even noticing the longer load times that the external drives supposedly cause. It works exactly as advertised.I've been seeing a lot of reviews complaining that the unit died on them, or that it ceases to work after a certain amount of time owned, and although those are valid points, it should also be noted that every single external hard drive in existence is physically frail--Seagate's drives are no exception and no other brand is exempt from this. They are extremely delicate machines with tons of brittle moving parts inside of them, and no part of that can reallt be helped. You have to take utmost care of the drive and make sure it isn't dropped (even a single foot drop can kill it) or shaken (i.e. make sure you pad it if you travel or walk with it, i.e. when in a backpack). Even then, drives eventually decay after a few years depending on how you treat them.Given the fragility of items like these, you'd do well to keep a cloud backup of any irreplaceable data you want to keep on it, though personally, I couldn't care less about this as I own all my video games through Steam and Game Pass, i.e. I keep no irrepleacable content in the drive.If any of the above bothers you, then external hard drives are probably not for you and you're better of using regular USB drives, or just update your internal hardware. This is a good product for what it is."
2811,5,Works for PlayStation 4,Just what my son needed to add more storage for games
2812,4,Difficult to schedule backup time,I back up my desktop daily but would like to be able to schedule the timing.Right now it tends to back upEVERYTHING when I sign on in the morning and again at noon.Since I am a real estate broker - I am online a lot and the backup slows my system down to a crawl..Any suggestions?The tiny pamphlet that came with this device is pretty useless.Thanks.Ann Spadafora
2813,5,Crashed after 6 months!,"It just randomly stopped working, you could hear it struggling to attempt to load storage onto to my ps4. I've only had it for 6 months and it's done !! Poor quality. Don't waste your money for a few months worth of storage."
2814,3,Noisy after three weeks like a train,"Problem... and return window is closed.Noisy like a truck, doesn't matter which direction.I would shy away this was a poor decision.."
2815,5,Good quality and storage,good quality and very light weight
2816,5,Hasta el momento a funcionado muy bien con mi PS4no me q fallado.,
2817,5,This works perfectly with the Xbox one !!!!!,If you are looking for a drive that will work with the Xbox one??? This is it!!!!
2818,5,"Good product, timely delivery","Good product, timely delivery"
2819,1,Stopped working in less than one month,Use for Xbox storage- downloaded5games easily then stopped working everything lost. Tech had no answer only wanted to refund for device. Games costs a lot these days.
2820,1,Not reliable,"I used it once to transfer some critical data on Day 1. The next time I plugged it in, the LED would light up but it wasn't recognized as an external drive. Tried a bunch of different disk management tools on Linux, Windows, and Mac, but no response. I was now stuck with a dead drive that had critical data on it."
2821,5,Muy buen disco duro calidad precio,El producto muy bueno!
2822,1,Does not work on older computers.,I bought this hard drive to store pictures from my older Mac. Requires 10.9 or later. My old Mac does not update anymore. Useless.
2823,1,Only review you need,"First amazon review but an important one for anyone editing. Do not buy this drive as anything but a backup drive. First off it's not 14tb it's 12.7tb. Trust me I formatted it many times. I'm fine with a 10TB drive actually being 980gb, but for this to be listed as 14 and then 1.3tb is shorted is ridiculous. The drive is insanely slow and so bad for even minor editing that I thought something was wrong with my computer. If you intentions are to buy this, hook it up when you need a secondary backup. go for it. otherwise stay away."
2824,3,good,good storage for large files.
2825,1,Broke after 1 day,"Need to be really carful with this, save your money I think SSD might be more better I literally just placed it on my PC with not that much force and already heard beeping sounds coming from it."
2826,1,It don't work for my ps4,It don't work for my ps4
2827,1,Came out of the box broken,Plugged it into my MAC and said defective won't work for MAC. So what is the point of saying it will if it won't. Immediately returned.
2828,4,Can be an issue with a Mac,"It arrived on time, is nice and small and works well.However, I had issues installing it with my Mac.Seagate customer service via chat was courteous and said it was an Apple issue and to contact them.Luckily, Apple was very helpful and we had to ""erase"" the new drive.Why would we need to erase a new drive?Mystery to me.......So, my issue is with installation not at all with the product itself which is fine"
2829,3,Not 2TB,Only 1.8? Am I missing something.
2830,5,Great buy!,Was a great value for it's price!!! I am very satisfied!
2831,5,Es un buen artículo,Sí me agradó porque grabó cosas en el
2832,5,Nice,Nice
2833,1,Don't buy Its waste of money,Don't buy Its waste of money
2834,5,Very happy with this purchase,"I was a little nervous after reading reviews since I have a Mac, but I figured I would just send it back if it didn’t work. But as soon as I plugged it in it asked me if I wanted to reformat it to my Mac and let me know that would erase anything already on it (which it had nothing cuz it was brand new) so I hit yes and it immediately reformatted and has been working great! Great price for the amount of storage as well."
2835,5,This 5TB External Hard Drive fits in my pocket!,"I was able to add this 5TB Hard Drive to my laptop and it is wonderful for storage of all my photos, movies and music.It also is small enough to fit in my pocket as well as my pocketbook.YAHOO!!!👍🏻🌹❤️"
2836,5,Totally functional,I bought this portable hard drive to expand memory space of my son's PlayStation 4. It is totally compatible and functional for its purpose with a very compact design.
2837,5,Time will tell,"This is relatively new technology (18TB) and the test of time is what will determine whether or not this is a successful purchase.If it stands that test, the price was reasonable and delivery was timely and I will be a very happy camper."
2838,5,Truly a Plug and Play Device,My husband and I aren't terribly tech-savvy.We purchased an external hard drive a couple years ago and were never able to get it to work.I was hesitant to buy this one but my husband has a lot of video files from his drone and it takes too long to upload them to a cloud storage.My husband was able to plug this unit in and begin saving his video files without ANY issue!I couldn't be happier!Great product!!!
2839,5,"Awesome, Should Have Gotten One Sooner","I’ve had this for a while, but I wanted to give it time before I reviewed. It’s an easy set up…just plug it in and navigate to the right menu on your system to get it to recognize it. For me it’s a PS4. I have so many more games on my system now, ones I already had and tons of new ones and still more space leftover.A word of caution…if you decide you want to unfulfilled it you have to into the system to disconnect it first and wait for the system to tell you it’s safe to unplug it. I unplugged it without knowing this and got a message that I can risk corrupting my device by doing that. If your system shuts off by itself, like if you lose power you have to go to a special menu to “repair” it then it’s OK again."
2840,1,Would not connect after1 week.,This product was not miss handled or abused but after one week of using it for storing photos from my wife’s camera it would not connect to the computer and or would not sync. Just turned it into a brick
2841,4,Love seagate drives,They work well. Last forever and are portable. Great hard drive at a great price
2842,5,Thre it into a wall,Great product with stand physical damage and doesn't break
2843,5,Works as it should and does it easily.,I bought this to extend the storage of my XBOX One X. It was basically plug and play by following the instructions on the screen. I was able to copy and download games immediately. The read speed has been flawless.
2844,5,When extra storage is needed,This works great according to my grandson.
2845,1,Garbage - Lost Everything in 2 Days,All files were corrupted in 2 days. Lost everything I put on it and have no way to retrieve anything. ABSOLUTE GARBAGEDO NOT BUY!
2846,5,Works great,"Work great, easy to use."
2847,4,Portátil y práctico,"Buen producto, llegó antes de lo esperado en buenas condiciones."
2848,5,Fulfilled my immediate and long term needs,Having the ability to know that all my info. Is automatically saved gives me peace of mind.
2849,4,For spinning HD it works.,"Needed extra power for Wii U, and it has HDD speeds (not SSD). For the cost, it works well for video games."
2850,5,Great Backup,Amazingly easy to set up and use. I cannot believe the advances in external storage devices over the years. The device came with the necessary cables so all was go from the start.
2851,5,Reliable Portable Drive,"Needed more space for pictures and other documents, this worked out well, can't comment on the Tech Support since I never needed it. The backup software worked well."
2852,1,Junk,"Wouldn’t work, have to return just complete garbage"
2853,2,Something's up with Seagate drives,"I'd highly recommend downloading SeaTools from the Seagate website and using it to check your drive before you use it. The one I ordered failed. Returned it, and the replacement failed straight out of the box. Returned that, and that one's replacement failed too. No point throwing bad money after good, I'll try my luck with a different brand from now on."
2854,5,This works with ANY game system,"Bought this for my son's new Xbox S series and for my other son's Xbox X series. Also, works on Playstation 4 and 5."
2855,1,Se daño a los tres meses de uso,"Se daño a los tres meses de uso y se perdió toda la Info almacenada, no obtuvimos soporte"
2856,1,Not downloading even after it was formatted.,"I bought this for my PS4 because I don’t have anymore space. Plugged it in, formatted it, set it as the app install location, and it still doesn’t work. Won’t download any games or anything else. Highly disappointed."
2857,5,"My Second One. Feeling Cute, Might Buy Another.. Dunno.","This 2TB Seagate HDD is affordable, and seems to work just fine. I've been using one for a few months, with RetroPie/OS on an SD card, running a Pi 4. I bought this one for a different Pi 4 that's going in my Atari Fight Stick.. (It took > 3.5 hours to transfer around 1.27TB from a 2TB WD to the Seagate) Also, I don't anticipate heat being an issue when mounted into the Fight Stick cabinet, as this HDD seems to run fairly cool."
2858,5,Came on time and works great.,Needed an external hard drive to backup my new laptop and it worked out and got it at a good price
2859,5,Great product,I love how fast it transferred all my files. It was over ten thousand files transferred in a matter of about half an hour most of which were videos.
2860,3,2ND ATTEMPT,"2TB locked up would not allow me to transfer files.Extremely slow.must be nuts but, I'm going to attempt a 4 tbATTEMPTING THE 4 TB TRANSFER RATE IS VERY SLOW.NEEEDED TO SWAP OUT A CABLE FROM ANOTHER DRIVE AS THE ONE PROVIDED IS CAUSING THE DRIVE TO PAUSE CRASH ETC.CAN'T BELIEVE A 5 YR OLD CABLE WORKS BETTER THAN THE ONE PROVIDED VERY UNHAPPY.hOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T SEIZE UP LIKE THE OTHER ONE DID."
2861,5,What I needed,works great! backed up my laptop!
2862,5,Super,Like it
2863,1,Delivered in original package,Great product but for some reason it was delivered in the original packaging and thank goodness no one stole it off the porch!
2864,5,It's exactly what I needed,I love itIt's great
2865,5,Really useful,I order this product for my gaming pc and it works great it does say 12 tb but mine showed 10 tb but it is still good I downloaded all most all the games I have (I have a lot) and there was still had 8 tb left and it really is good if it is two expensive I would get a 2 tb or a 5 tb (for gaming) and a 1 tb for work purposes would recommend.
2866,1,died after 1 year,This died after one year of use. All my information stored is gone.
2867,1,Fragile cable and port,Stay away from this drive- it has known manufacturing defects. The brand new drive I bought would disconnect itself every time I slightly touched the cable. I know my computer is not the issue because all of the other USB devices I use work just fine. I contacted Seagate support and they said it was probably the cable or the port- it is a known manufacturing defect. I returned my drive to Amazon and received a new one. That new one had the same issue. I returned that one and bought a Western Digital hard drive that works great and has no issues.
2868,1,"Software faulty,",Because of a an internal software problemwith the drive I was never able to use it.
2869,5,Works great!,The product works very well on my New Android based Sony TV.I use it as a HD movie and music video library and it works perfectly well with no hitches.
2870,1,Received wrong item,"I’ve had this hard drive previously, no problems with it. I bought another one and Amazon delivered the wrong item, and then they ask me to return it even though they were the ones who made the mistake. Unbelievable."
2871,1,This does not work on MacBook pros,I bought this as an external hard drive for my MacBook Pro and it never worked.
2872,5,worth the money,speeds up computer when freeing up space on your internal hard-drive.
2873,3,50 50,I ordered 2 1 failed and had to be sent back. The replacement arrived quickly.
2874,5,Need,Good
2875,4,Short on Storage,"Right out of the box this seems to be working OK. The only surprise and disappointment was in total usable space available on the drive. It was well under 13 TB. Since the storage was considerably less than I expected, this changes the price value of this item quite a bit.Still this is a lot of storage!"
2876,3,Only 14TB,I ordered 16TB. This is only 14TB. It's also much noisier than Western Digital.
2877,5,Very compact,I love that this drive is so compact andportable!
2878,5,Super easy to install!,Works perfectly with your Tablo DVR
2879,1,"Bad product, inconvenient customer support","Be forewarned--this is not a plug and play device if you're using a Mac.After Googling why I couldn't create folders or drag-n-drop on this drive, I did some Googling and the Seagate website advised I would have to reformat the drive for it to work on a Mac.After following the instructions on the Seagate website, the device is no longer recognized by my computer.I currently have a $60 brick sitting on my desk.And the best part?Seagate customer service is only open from 8-6 on weekdays, when I'm working.Thanks for nothing.If I could give this product less than one star I would."
2880,1,"Drop it once, it's over.","Not only slow. Hook it to your laptop. Pull the tiny cord by mistake. It falls to a wood floor. It's done. Disk errors, and it doesn't work."
2881,5,Exactly fit my needs for external storage,Was looking for a good external expansion and I received a great unit with this purchase.
2882,4,SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO FOLLOW FRIENDS' ADVICES ON WHAT BRAND TO BUY,"My best friend recommended the Seagate brand of hard drive. He didn't disappoint me. The 2TB is more than enough for my thousands and thousands of photos and files to keep in one place. Before I have 3 32GB of flash drives (USB) and still not enough for my photos and files to store. THANK YOU, AMAZON!"
2883,1,Don’t work,This does not work with the new X box sires X will not show up or anything do not buy for Xbox and takes a long time to get your money back if you even do I am still waiting to get my money back.
2884,5,Great bang for your buck!,Purchased as external drive to expand Xbox storage.I have 3 of these. All work great no problems!
2885,5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This item came very well packaged, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I was able to back up my entire laptop, and I could probably fit about four more laptops information on it"
2886,1,Click of death 1.5 months in,Bought for backups. Placed in a ventilated space in temperature controlled room amongst other usb hdds. Got the click of death from the drive after 1.5 months of service and the system is no longer able to recognize the drive.
2887,3,Second one that I have owned that has problems.,I've hardly used this one and it already is having problems.
2888,4,ALWAYS TEST YOUR NEW HARD DRIVES - PSA,"What I'm about to tell you will potentially save you from future catastrophic failures including loss of data. Nothing beats having multiple good backup copies.; however, the following information will instruct you on how to test your new drive to make sure it's free from defects.Imagine, you have a spinning disk rotating thousands of times per minute separated by its recording/reading head by less thickness of a human hair. Just one wrong thing and .. ""click..click..click"".You don't want that.Generally speaking a bad hard drive will make itself known sooner vs later when it's tested fully. Not always. What YOU can do is put the hard drive through its paces to really give it a good solid work out and make sure every space designated by the drive as available/writeable space, is in fact GOOD. Its magnetic/electrical properties strong.This test is a LONG test. What it does is write all 0s, 1s, 0-1s. 1-0s (binary) to the disk. It does this in 4 passes (i.e. writes the disk fully) 4 times. After each write it will read what was just written beginning to end to ensure all bits were written exactly right.If they wern't, the drive's detection mechanism for errors (SMART) will notice (i.e. a bit was not written to a sector correctly) and flag the SMART COUNTER. For example, uncorrectable or reallocated sector count would show a non-0 value.During operation, if the drive encounters a fault with a sector it will swap that sector with another known good sector the drive has in reserve and will log it via SMART.A PERFECTLY WORKING HARD DRIVE WILL SHOW '0' for 'Reallocated Sector Count','Reported Uncorrectable Errors','Current Pending Sector Count','Uncorrectable Sector Count'.IF ANY OF THESE VALUES SHOWS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A 0 (zero), THEN YOU HAVE A FAILING HDD AND SHOULD REPLACE IT ASAP. DO NOT TRUST YOUR DATA ON IT.This command will erase everything on the disk if there is data already on there when you run this test. For a 5TB it took me over 4 days. But I am confident the data will be safe because it worked out the drivehard and pictures above show good numbers.Boot up your computer using a linux distribution boot usb/cd. Debian Ubuntu, any one will do--it doesn't matter.In a terminal type: sudo fdisk -l*Identiy which /dev is your HDD you wish to test. Also note if it says 512 or 4096 where it says ""Sector size (logical/physical)"". For example, if it's /dev/sde and says 4096 Sector Size (such as this 5tb drive) then type the following command:sudo badblocks -wsv -b 4096 -c 131072 /dev/sdeThis will 0,1,01,10 write and read/verify the drive back-to-back in 4 passes. On my slow computer via USB 3, this took around4.5 days to complete.The ' -b 'option is the Block Size. This should match the drive. 512 or 4096. The '-c' option tells badblocks how many blocks to test at time. Changing this number will alter the speed and will either make the process go along faster or slower (dependant on Drive Interface, Ram/Cpu speed, etc.). Instead of '-c 131072' ,try '-c 65536 if it seems the test is taking too long to increment the %'s.In fact try it with '-c 65536' option. Let it run or 30 sec then CTRL-C to cancel it. Then run the command again but with '-c 131072' instead. Run it for 30 sec then CTRL-C to cancel. Compare the 2 and whichever command that had thehigher % when you CTRL-C'd would be the number you would choose since that one ran a little bit faster.Google or man page 'badblocks' for more information.Whenever you buy a new hard drive get into the mindset/habit that you will NOT use them for at least a week (or 2) because you have to test them out first. Trust me on this and it's totally worth it. I'd like to think I avoid catastrophic failures because I did this test and it would have presented itself (or at least more likelihood) then vs months/years down the road. That's not a given--any drive can fail anytime or any reason but this is just an additional layer. Like a ""shakedown cruise' if you will.Regarding this drive: Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive HDD – USB 3.0, I can say that I am pleased it tested clean and I look forward to using this drive.And I'm confident it will keep my data intact.You are welcome!"
2889,5,For PS4 it's great!,"I bought this drive for my PS4.It’s fast, it’s small and it’s quiet.I had no problem setting it up.All you have to do is go into the PS4 settings and have it formatted for PS4.Other than that, you just plug it in and it does the rest.No stress, no fuss and lots of room."
2890,5,Never Thought I Could Afford a 4TB HDD,"What is not to Like?Worked Flawlessly Straight out of the Box.True Plug & Play. Instructions Not Needed.I did not Partition My Drive. I just Plugged it in and started to load it up with My Movies and Music.The Drive is so quiet that the only way to know it is running is to see if the little light is on, or feel the very minor vibration when You touch it.I did not expect it to access My files as quickly as it does. I can't tell that I have it plugged into My powered Hub.It will take some time and heavy use (which I am doing now) to see if it has Longevity.Vendor got this HDD to Me Super Fast and Packaged Very Well."
2891,5,Life Saving if without One Drive,This has been a Godsend since my old desktop oddly didn't have One Drive syncing everything. Took a few days but I got everything transferred easy.
2892,5,Great price!!!,How can you NOT love the value of this deal???
2893,5,Just as described,Good product
2894,5,EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT
2895,5,Great HDD,I’d take a picture of the HDD but it’s put up safely with important files! It’s a fast product and comes in handy if needed to place media files within the Harddrive. I have lots of Seagate HDDs that’s lasted for years and I would recommend anyone who needs external storage to do buy them and be sure to everyone once in a while back them up.
2896,4,"Good back up storage, if not used daily","I use it only as back up, not for daily use, and it’s sufficient for me. When I tried to open a video file copied to the drive, the video crashed more than once. the file itself was intact when I copied it back to my computer. It also took about 3 hours to transfer all my back up files to this drive. All and all, it’s an okay HDD drive."
2897,5,Large scale backup in a small package,Large scale backup in a small package.A bit noisy.Hopefully it will not crash over time.The drive noise on spin up is concerning.
2898,4,Big storage but a little slow,"Small size, lot's of storage, plug & play. Use it to store videos. Not the fastest drive but works well. Overall happy"
2899,5,USB powered 5 TB Seagate drive the size of a couple packs of playing cards.,"I like it because it’s Seagate - they’ve earned my trust over years of use. I’ve been growing my personal ’cloud’ since their 1TB drives.As my storage needs have grown, the Seagate capacity has quintupled, and the reliability remains awesome."
2900,5,Wors good,Works on my TV and cp
2901,5,Its good,It's good because you can download so much gamebut the the only thing I don't like is that you can't store next gen game on it
2902,3,Not for the Xbox series x/s,It’s too slow for the Xbox series x/s.
2903,1,Did not last 1 year,Died after almost exactly one year. If that is a lifespan it is very disappointing. Computer will not recognize it and so disk utility could not help. Just makes a soft beeping sound. Sad.
2904,5,It's a really good purchase.,It works perfect and my console can read it to. I was skeptical at 1st but after trying it for a week. It hasn't disappoint.
2905,5,Great product great price,Great for video and photo storage.
2906,5,Excelente,"Muy buena calidad, funciona super bien"
2907,1,I don’t understand this thing,"I got way too excited when I made this purchase that I literally unboxed it, threw everything away. Now that im finally trying to set it up, which I didn't think would be that hard to do, my computer is saying it can't transfer anything because the item is damaged or not working. Hence the image I screenshotted. I don’tknow what to do since I threw away the packaging but clearly it doesn't work."
2908,5,Work ok,Simple set up. Working fine so far.
2909,5,Worked well.,"Backup for computer. Worked well, however, took a few tries."
2910,2,"If you have shaky hands, do NOT purchase.","I had it for about 5 months, and it was working great. The one time I drop it on the ground, I plug it back into my laptop and Xbox One and it doesn't even get recognized. Funny, because the light shows that it's ""working"", even though it doesn't pop up. What a shame, wish I could get a refund for $55 worth."
2911,1,Did not work properly!!,Fail when I tried to download small files. Old version.
2912,1,Testing this drive reminds me why I swore off HDDs a few years ago in favor of SSDs,"Went through two of these in a row over a few-week period before throwing in the towel to request a refund. I thought maybe I’d be able to save money on a quick way to consolidate my montage of disjointed backups onto a single large drive where it would be easier to search/sort duplicates/versions. But all this did was make things more complicated and waste pretty much every second of my time for weeks.First, the drive is incredibly noisy. I mean really noisy. None of my other, far older HDDs are anywhere close to this loud. It sounds like something pretty destructive is going on inside there. Within a couple weeks, it sounded like it was failing, the way old drives sound when they’re on their last leg before croaking permanently.Second, I could never get more than about 1.5 TB copied to the 14 TB drive before the whole drive croaked on me. It wouldn’t mount at all on one machine, and on another it gave disk utility errors and could not be reformatted at all. It was apparently bricked. It’s very slow and seemingly sucks up a lot of power, even despite the independent AC power source.At first, with the first one that arrived, I thought maybe it got damaged during shipment, as it was during the period when packages were getting lost/stolen left and right (or blamed on “sorting errors”). So I requested a replacement. Almost everything coming out of Amazon was days to weeks late, maybe related to the train heist saga, but who knows?But then I received the second one. And sure enough, the same thing happened within two weeks, and at almost the same point (1.5 TB out of 14 TB). At least this time, the grinding sound coming from the drive was far less alarming, and I was able to find a machine with software that would allow me to successfully reformat the drive even though it wouldn’t properly mount. But I cannot risk trying the backup again. I’ve already wasted weeks on this endeavor, when I could have just spent 3x as much money to buy the SSD I originally wanted to get. Especially when it would have saved me weeks of time I could have been spending on other important work.I’ve never had this kind of trouble with my Western Digital or SanDisk drives, but sometimes it happens with Seagate and LaCie, though nothing as irritating and troublesome as this, and certainly not when the drives were brand new.Only twice in my life that I can recall (in over 30 years) have I purchased a non-bus-powered hard drive, and both were from Seagate/LaCie. So is it a lack of quality control from them? Or is it happenstance?From now on, I think I’ll stick to WesternDigital/SanDisk, since I’ve never had any issues with their drives, whether HDD or SSD. Now, I have to start all over with my backup consolidation task, after I order the SSDs I should have bought in the first place. Never again will I entertain the notion of going backward to antiquated rotating drive technology. But that’s just me. Your choice is obviously up to you and your needs."
2913,5,100% recommend,Fast and easy to setup. Used on Xbox and took no more than a minute to set it up.
2914,4,Bought for Xbox use,"Okay so I bought this to use with our Xbox one as it's run out of space. Well, at first I was pretty frustrated. You should be able to plug this in and the Xbox will ask to format for use, mine wouldn't and would only recognize it for media storage. Went to settings, storage and attempted to format that way. WOULD NOT let me. Plugged into my computer and discovered it wasnt factory reset.... After a formatting to factory settings, plugging back and opening it in the settings I could finally use for games!Don't rush to return if it's not working! It's definitely worth investigating first. Killer price for the size!"
2915,4,"Hefty brick, but crazy capacity",The device is definitely bigger than I initially thought it would be. And it requires an additional power source to run fully. Not something you can just plug into your computer on its own. It is definitely a desk top only type of storage device. But the capacity is definitely appreciated. And I never really planned on carrying this thing around in my backpack anyway. It's mainly for peace of mind for all of my data so I'm happy with it.
2916,4,Do your research!,"I used the amazon search bar to look for ""2018 Macbook Pro Compatible Hard Drives"" and this came up. 100% my fault for not actually looking closely at the product to see that you need to have a USB port on your laptop.Make sure you snag yourself an adapter so you can actually USE the product, don't be dumb like me. Otherwise, this is a great product once you get it all up and running. I just use it mainly to store my digital versions of movies and backup my macbook so it works perfectly for me."
2917,3,No optimization,The drive isnr fast enough for some games
2918,5,Hooked up to my laptop,"I use this for my hunting, trail, and GoPro pics and videos. A great way to keep all my picks in one place. Easy to use and portable"
2919,1,The drive died in two months,Not worth buying. This it the second one to fail on me.
2920,5,Love it,"Small,easy to install.Just remember to properly disconnect in settings before unplugging from system.Works on Ps4 with no problems so far."
2921,5,Great for storing backups,"The data transfer rate isn't great over the cable provided, but it works just fine for storing backups occasionally."
2922,5,Works flawlessly with my PS5,Best bang for the buck! Has performed perfectly with my PS5!
2923,5,It's too new,Too new for me to rate the durability but so far so good.
2924,5,So Far So Good,I simply plugged the device into the playstation and transferred everything to it and it seems to be working great! I have only been fooling around with it the night before but it seems pretty easy to work with. Good product so far!
2925,5,Great,I added this to my husband's gaming pc for extra storage. Hes running ESO off this drive as the game is about 90GB plus all his add-ons. The game runs smooth with no bottle necking or long load screens.
2926,5,Great Portable Hard drive,"Bought it back in July of 2021, which has served me well thus far. Haven't had any issues storing large files like games or massive collections of photos. Good purchase, only gripe being is it's just a bit awkward to situate on my table because of the short cable. But other than that I love it."
2927,5,Buena calidad y muy util,Buena calidad y muy util Facil de instalar
2928,5,Works Perfect,Great item at a great price to extend storage on my laptop.
2929,4,Good price. Relatively fast. Sound is concerning.,Great for the price. I've always preferred Seagate to WD.Wish it would have come with a USB C cable.Also the ac cable plug makes a whirring sound whether plugged into the wall or a surge protector. Honestly sounds like a siren. Kind of alarming honestly.
2930,5,nice drive,does the job at a fair price
2931,1,Crashed after 4 months,"Can’t recommend this drive.I bought it in Sept and it’s now at a data recovery site trying to recover my data.I was told and quote “the drive is currently in degrading physical condition.Electronic failure has damaged the read/write head(s).Replacement of failed components, physical stabilization and logical reconstruction will be necessary for data retrieval.”When I told them I had just purchased this drive in September they were speechless.Simply put…BUYER BEWARE!!"
2932,5,Quiet and stays cool,Had it for a few months now and works great.It stays cool and quiet when running.I have it set up on my own movie streaming collection that I share with family and friends.Had to upgraded my old 4TB to an 8TB.
2933,5,Great storage,Great item ill buy it again
2934,1,Get WD or Toshiba hard drive.,"Work fine for a week then stop working, happy I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund. Got a Toshiba hard drive it works fine. No Thank You on the Seagate 5TB hard drive."
2935,5,Gift,For picture storage
2936,5,Good product,It was exactly what I needed
2937,1,Item not preprogrammed well,You'd need to be a well versed nerd to reconfigure for Mac -Much too confusing and not up to date with newer technology
2938,5,spacious,"used for data backup, mostly photos"
2939,1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"Purchased a few months ago to help with storage on my computer. Broke after a few weeks of use. Won’t even power on anymore. Tried swapping cords, nothing worked. 2TB of data completely gone. Don’t buy this garbage."
2940,5,Use it for Apple time machine back ups.,Works great for time machine. If you have two Macs you can partition the drive for two different time machines.
2941,5,Good,Worth the money
2942,5,Hard drive,Best price you will find for all that storage
2943,1,Cable problems,The cable was in factory packaging but in damaged condition
2944,1,How the products even works... not instructions,"No instructions how to access or even check to see what it has copied or not. It's plugged in but I can't see anyway to verify that it has copied my documents, photos, or videos. Would not recommend."
2945,5,Still working good afterv8 yrs,"Bought it in 2014 it still works great.The only problem I have is lately, since my last Mac update, I have to unplug it at night and replug it in the mornings.I never had to before.Updates... sometimes I dread them.But it still saves everything and the data is easy to find and view.If it died tomorrow I'd buy another one."
2946,5,Ease of use,This Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive was very easy to use and set up on my laptop.
2947,1,Not 12T Item,Only 10.9 T instead of 12.I probably will return.
2948,5,So all you guys saying it doesn't work for the Mac...,"...I've been using seagate and mac my whole young life. All it takes is an extra step of connecting the hub, go to Desk Utility and format it to Mac OS Journaled instead of exFat. At first the original fo mating will be erased so you’ll be partitioning again to Mac OS Journaled.So far it's working flawlessly on my Mac Mini High Sierra (i haven't downloaded the recent one for other reasons) but it works on that iOS version. I'll leave a review if I notice anything weird. But so far, it's been pretty quiet and sitting nicely on my desk."
2949,5,Great product. Caution when purchasing.,"It's exactly what it says a 4 tb USB external HD. I had bought this for my Xbox Series S and it is compatible with the system. The only issue is the HD is not compatibile with the newer generation games. If the game dad X/S on it, you can store the game but it cannot be played from there."
2950,5,AMAZING,My friends didn’t believe I would get Two TB for$60!!! But it works amazing I love it
2951,1,Never worked,Could not get it to work. Its just a waste of time and money.
2952,5,Works great,Bought for extra pictures and videos
2953,5,Good,Had it for a while now and have not come up to any problems with it
2954,5,Beautiful,"Bought it for my Series S, very good, don’t let these other reviews fool you."
2955,5,WORKS GREAT,I gave this to a neighbor as a gift.He loves it.
2956,5,Good brand,My kiddos love to play and storage his heavy games and this product is perfect for it.
2957,5,Holds all the data!,"I remember when a 500gb hard drive was the size of three bricks stacked on top of each other, imagine the challenge bringing that “collection” to Iraq was… now this thing can fit in my back pocket and I literally have thousand of quality “films” to watch on my laptop, it’s a shame they ended OIF and OEF, now I have to go camp in my backyard with my laptop to recreate the experience… “LEAVE ME ALONE MOM!!!!”"
2958,4,Sometimes slow as Molasses in winter,"Today it was working fast as expected!previous comments:It transfers at 335Kbps a second, yes Kili-bits not megabite or gigibites.At this rate it would takes months to fill it up.Another USB 2 drive plugged into the same USB port runs at 30 Mbps.A USB 3 should be 10 times faster, not 8 times slower. This was a waste of money."
2959,5,Easy plug and use,Using for Xbox storage. No issues and set up was seemless
2960,5,Great buy!,Great drive I bought it for my xbox series s and its lets me download like 40 games sofar definitely a must buy if you don't wanna spend 250 dollars on the same thing but in a different design
2961,1,Does not work for Mac - False Advertising,"Tried to use this on my Mac and it does not work. There is an icon that says ""Start here for Mac"" and it says it is damaged or incomplete. I couldn't add any files to it at all. False Advertising!"
2962,4,Does not work well,Lost all my pictures after the 3rd time of trying to draw them up.
2963,4,Works fine,Easy to hook up
2964,5,Great for ps4/xbox one,Was in need of extra storage for my consoles. Bought 2 hard drives. One for my Xbox one and another for my ps4. Now I have plenty of memory for games.
2965,5,Great external HD for Xbox Series X!,"Great external HD for Xbox Series X! You can store and play your Xbox 360 & Xbox One games on it. You can also store Series X&S on it-but you can't play those off this drive. So far it's kept me from having to buy the more expensive storage card for the Series X. Overall, I highly recommend!"
2966,3,It never worked when I got it,I love the site first thing I have gotten that didn’t work won’t stop me from doing further business
2967,2,Poor Lifespan,"Bought two of these now. First one crashed and lost all data on it. Now the second one constantly disconnects from my console. I repeatedly have to unplug it, and plug it back in to retrieve my content. Sometimes it disconnects in the middle of a game, causing the game to disconnect. Only reason it gets 2 stars is because it worked well the first few years I had it."
2968,3,Slow 5TB,"This writes at 20MB/s. My internet is faster than that. My SD cards are faster than that. My 3 year old 3TB WD drive is 5x faster than that. It's fine, but it's slow."
2969,5,Great,Works as it should. Bought for extra storage for my brother.
2970,4,You have to format it to be compatible with Mac,"This is not compatible with Mac. You have to format it to be compatible with Mac. It takes less than a minute to do so. There are videos on Youtube, search for 'Seagate Expansion How To Install / Set Up External Hard Drive on Mac | Manual | Setup Guide'. Just erase the drive, scheme to 'GUID Partition Map', format 'ExFat'(if you want it to work on Mac and windows), click erase.You will then be able to transfer the files from mac and windows."
2971,5,Good deal,Met my needs
2972,5,Disco duro externo portátil Seagate de 2 TB,Muy bien cumple con lo prometido..
2973,4,Very good,The data transferred very well
2974,1,Doesn't work,I attempted to put (increasingly smaller) video files on this hard drive and each time it never went past 80%. Returning.
2975,5,It worked fine.,Easy to use.
2976,5,Great for Xbox One games.,"Used to add an extra 2TB of storage to my Xbox One. Easy peasy to get set up and working. Plugged it in to USB port and good to go, holds and plays games well. Doesn't take up much space, just sits next to the console and it's relatively inconspicuous due to the black color.Would also work well for storage PC files, etcetera, I'm just not using it for that."
2977,5,Storage,Great product!
2978,5,I gave it a 4 star on portability only because you have to have a place to plug it in,I like that I can now carry all my movies and pictures with one drive not 16. I wish they would make a large hard drive the Dont need to be plugged in the wall. Otherwise I love the hard drive. The price was great also.
2979,5,Xbox one S compatible,Perfect for the Xbox one S. Easy install.
2980,1,Crashed on me and made me lose my data. Wasn't a good buy.,Didn't like anything about it.
2981,5,perfect for X box,Great price and exactly what I needed to help the storage needs for my sons X BOX
2982,5,Very compact,Light and easy to store
2983,5,Perfect! Really saved me a lot of hassle,"This totally saved me! I was so fed up trying to backup my computer and this one made it so easy. I just wish I has bought it sooner. But, it arrived super fast so it wasn't too bad."
2984,5,Great external drive!,Daughter needed extra storage and this works perfectly!
2985,5,Great for storage and portability.,The portable hard drive was used to capture video/audio from a film producer which became an excellent choice for both portability and storage. I highly recommend this product. It is lightweight and small enough similar to a small hardcover book to send in the mail.
2986,1,Dogged Slow. 6 Hours to Copy 1 GB!,Dogged Slow. My prior 4TB copied a 1-GB folder in 3 minutes. Same folder on this 6TB was going to be 6 hours. Seagate has gone to the dogs. Set up a return for the same day I received it.
2987,5,Plug & Play,"Plugged it into my machine with rhe included cable and it was immediately recognized, visible and ready to use - no software, formatting or driver installation needed. Works exactly as expected, no hiccups, fast, easy to use & reliable."
2988,5,it works,It works
2989,1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS,"Stopped working after 3 months, maybe used about 30 times in my xbox.Would not recommend this hard drive"
2990,1,Bad,Don’t get it it doesn’t let u play ur games
2991,5,It definitely works!,"Got it and immediately connected to my PS4, it works like a charm. I've already downloaded 14 games on it and no problems plus I've barely scratched the surface of it's storage copassity. It downloads at a good speed as well. Love it. ⭐⭐⭐ ⭐ ⭐"
2992,5,Beats Thumb Drives Hands Down,"The speed at which this drive downloads files is amazingly fast, a pleasant relief compared to my old jack-of-all-files 64-gig thumbdrive.Utterly silent. Great bargain. I can't recommend this highly enough."
2993,5,Using 12TB for video backup.,"I have a lot of video and needed a larger drive and have had good luck with external Seagates of smaller capacities so I decided to get a couple of 12TB.I read of others complaining about write speeds, but I don't time my drives.I set them to copying and do other things till they are done.I don't notice much difference with these than others I've used.All I know is they both work and can play back my videos with no problem.That is all I need or want."
2994,4,Good choice,"Good product for the price. The only issue is that it doesn’t consistently connect automatically and you need to go into settings to connect. Overall, it’s a good value and I would purchase it again."
2995,2,I use tons of portable drives and the write speed is awful..,This drive took 18 hours to write just over 1 TB of data.. USB 3.0 alone would give you 300MB/s .. which should take an hour or so.. awful
2996,5,Works perfectly for PS4,Works perfectly for ps4. Didn’t need to do that much setip
2997,5,use it as back up device,Trusted name device.
2998,5,Tablo tv dvr storage,Tablo tv dvr storage. Easy formatted through Tablo app. Works much better than old (2014) seagate 1 tb
2999,1,"Don’t buy, it’s garbage","Product worked for 2 months, backed up photos and documents, After 2 months does not work and can not retrieve anything I saved on it. Not even worth the time o spent on it. Straight rip off!! Not worth even 1 star"
3000,1,Do not buy,"Terrible. Used it 5x to back up my older hard drive and pics and vids from my phone,for just in case, and now it won't open on any computer or smart tv. Computer can see it, but won't open, and makes a beep sound every 3 seconds when plugged into anything."
3001,1,"Software that comes on the drive is ""damaged or incomplete""",The Seagate website is designed to not process a return for a defective product so beware.
3002,5,Plug and play,Connected and was able to sa.ve files to disk out of the box.No formatting needed for Windows.Was able to create a new Windows image and saved to drive.
3003,2,"Was great, until it sounded like broke down car and died","Had less than a year, worked perfectly until it died. Started making a strange noise and never again was able to even be read. My entire media library gone in a moment. Would never buy again."
3004,1,Does NOT work.,I NEVER leave bad reviews NEVER!But this expensive thing doesn't show up on ANY computer.Of course it says I have to return by jan 31st and it's the 2nd so no change of getting refund.Cannot even tell you how upset I am.
3005,5,Love it!,Needed a new portable drive and this is a perfect drive for the job!
3006,1,Piece of crap so far,"Bought this to back up some work info. Had to end up taking it to a computer tech who also said he couldn’t get it to work. Said it was already full, but it was “new”?"
3007,5,Easy to use,Product suited my needs to backup my computer. Easy to use.
3008,1,Mine died after 14 months and I lost everything,"Suddenly my drive is making weird noises and my computer doesn't recognize it. I have been trying to troubleshoot and I see lots of people saying their Seagate drive died as well and to not trust them. Just wanted to put that out there for everyone else looking to purchase this. I am not sure which drive is better, but this is probably not the one. I am switching to cloud storage from now on. (oh, and this is the SECOND Seagate drive that died and I lost everything that time too!!!!)"
3009,3,It needs a lot of power for stable operation,"Attaching this thing to my Desktop and transferring a file caused the total system's power consumption to increase by an average of 8 watts. For comparison a 1TB Seagate Backup-Plus drive increased power consumption by an average of 5 Watts while doing the same job.The 1TB drive works flawlessly on both the front and rear ports of my desktop while the 5TB only works with rear ports.On my laptop, the 1TB drive works flawlessly even on the USB 2.0 port while this 5TB says its connectingbut never shows up in File Explorer. However, if I connect it to the laptop though a Powered USB 3.0 hub it works fine.I've seen enough dead electronics from improper matching of power supplies and devices. Using this on a USB port which cannot supply enough power will probably damage the drive and the port itself."
3010,5,Does the job.,Works very well on my Xbox Series S.
3011,5,"Was a good price, then they doubled it.","I got this on a deal at about half the price, went to purchase a new one exactly a year later, and found out about the price doubling. That inflation, I guess. The device works though, so that's good."
3012,1,It'd be great...if it worked...,"I bought this for my husband so he could install some games that were too big for his SSD on his laptop. He plugged it in and away he went! ...For about 20 minutes. It started beeping and stopped working. We thought maybe it was a faulty cable and that wasn't it. We thought it was a faulty USB port. Not it either. This machine apparently has to have some high-powered, extreme-energy-consuming computer to make it work properly. Usually I'm good with Seagate, but I would not recommend this one."
3013,5,EXCELENTE,"The media could not be loaded. Excelente producto, velocidad de transferencia de 100 - 110 MB/seg,una belleza."
3014,4,Good product but a tad misleading,"It works as well as any external but unfortunately when you search up PS5 external drive, this is the “best option”. Note that this device is incapable of storing PS5 games, it can only store PS4 games. It was cheap so I am too upset but at the same time if I had known this beforehand, I most likely would not have chosen it."
3015,5,Great,A++++++
3016,5,Perfect for PS5,Bought this for my sons new PS5. He loves it!!Easy to set up and small. He put velcro strips on it and attached it to the PS5 case.
3017,1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.IT IS GARBAGE.,"I BOUGHT IT ON 10-31-21, IT DIED ON 1-30-22DO NOT BUY IT.IT IS GARBAGE."
3018,5,fixed my son's computer hard drive problem.,fixed my son's computer hard drive problem.
3019,5,Bought for son,Great value for a portable storage uses it on his Xbox and hasn’t complained yet
3020,1,Fried after 3 months.,Going back to burning stuff on dvds. I don't trust any external drives anymore.
3021,5,Love it!,Love this external harddrive
3022,5,"Great, easy to use",Got this for my teen for use on his Xbox One
3023,5,Very good ex exellent,Good price and quality
3024,1,Ridiculous,You can't just back up your files. It has to be registered. They want to see you things. IT DOES NOT WORK ON A MAC!!!!! Windows only!
3025,5,A game changer,"Love this product, easy to use and definitely fast for downloading and uploading into my laptop"
3026,5,The best external hard drive I ever owned.,"After making a pact with myself to NEVER go back to Western Digital, I took a risk and bought this Seagate drive.I ended up loving this drive and will always buy Seagate drives from now on."
3027,4,It was good but it has a little less than 2 tb storage,It advertises 2tb hard drive but it actually has a little less it’s like 1.6
3028,4,Compatibility with new games,Lots of storage but wish it worked with newer games
3029,1,Terrible Performance! - Slows down to a crawl after 20 to 30 minutes,"Avoid!I purchased the 5TB version of this drive and it is simply not up to the task - it appears to have glaring performance issues - buy the WD Passport or Elements instead.What happens is after 20 to 30 minutes of continual operation (writing or reading) it starts to slow down to a snail's pace.At first, it flies along at 90 to 110MBs but then starts to get slower and slower.Eventually, it drops to 2MBs - 4MBs with occasional bursts of 30MBs.I tried this out on multiple systems various PCs (Windows 10), Linux, etc, the same result every time after a while slows to a snail's pace.Not sure if it is overheating, throttling, or just bad software/firmware/controller chip?The reason I know this is not an individual bad drive is that my 30 day Amazon return window had run out so I sent the drive back to Seagate for replacement.They responded quickly and sent me back a replacement (refurbished) drive.The replacement drive is acting the exact same way so I guess I am out of luck.I ended up replacing it with a 5TB WD Passport drive - which works flawlessly.The WD keeps up consistent read/write speeds of 90 to 100MBs and never drops below 60MBs for more than a couple of seconds.To give an exact comparison a 2.5TB copy of a mixture of thousands of small, medium, and large files from an ultra-fast NVMe SSD to the Seagate and WD Passport dives:Seagate 5TB Portable - 21 hours!Western Digital Passport - 7 hours (3 times faster)Bottom line - save yourself the time and expense - avoid buying this drive it is a piece of junk even if it has the ""Seagate"" logo on the front.Buy a WD equivalent even if you have to spend a few bucks more."
3030,4,Big Drive for Moderate Budgets,"It's 14TG big, USB 3.0 fast, and it's less than $250. That was all the math I needed."
3031,5,Good,super fast shipping--has been working great--plug and play
3032,5,Fast delivery! Easy to use! Great product.,A counselor of mine was listening to some great music one day in his office. I needed somewhere to download it this product made it so easy to download now I have great music. All at a click of a button 4 years of enjoyment.
3033,5,Muy buen producto Excelente calidad.,"Es mi primera vez comprando algo así, siempre uso USB o disco,no soy una experta en tecnología solo una mamá que le gusta tomarles muchas fotos a mi familia y mascotas así poder capturar esos pequeños momentos que luego desaparecen, pues ellos crecen muy rápido. Ya se hace muy difícil conseguir USB baratas y de buena calidad, y decidimos buscar aquí a ver que podía hacer para mantener nuestros recuerdos a salvo,bueno pese a quevi algunos malos comentarios, me pareció que era una de las mejores memorias externas, fácil de usar y poco espacio en mi cartera si la quiero llevar conmigo. La recomiendo. Excelente."
3034,5,My son loves it.,It does everything my son needs it to do.I'm definitely not upset with this purchase.
3035,5,Good stuff,"lightweight 2tb hard drive. Just plug in and use, no need to jump through any unnecessary hoops. The transfer speed is also impressive"
3036,1,Very Dissapointed,"Install was simple. Just plug in via USB port. Easy to Drop files.No problem. But I needed to go on a business trip and disconnected it from my desktop to use it with my laptop. It wouldn't load when I plugged it into my laptop. Severely hampered my business operations on location. When I got back home and plugged back into my desktop, nothing happened. I could not access my files. It would not show up in my directory tree at all. Very dissapointed."
3037,1,Newly device beeping sounds. Please how to fix this?,The media could not be loaded. I bought recently. I have saved some data in it. And trying to save more data BUT now it has sound which I am posting here with a video. This is a new device. Please how can I fix this?
3038,2,STOPPED WORKING,got it last year for a Christmas present got home from a friends house got on my computer and all 1.5 terabits of storage gone the device stopped working I now have to buy a new 50 dollar hard drive plz for your wallets safety do not buy this product.
3039,5,Excellent space!,Holds a lot of data for a reasonable price!!
3040,5,Good,Good
3041,5,Excellent buy.,AAA+worth the $
3042,5,Very convenient to use,Very user friendly and works great
3043,2,It allows you to store games on it. But won’t let you play the games while they are this device.,The PlayStation equivalent works for PlayStation but this one doesn’t for xbox
3044,5,Seagate external drive. It great because of the physical size. Easy to store.,I use my seagate external drive to backup my data and files on my desktop server
3045,3,"Good, but not for installing windows on it","I installed a VM on the Seagate and I am able to run Windows, however I keep getting an issue where the Seagate just disconnects randomly then immediately reconnects, causing Windows to crash. I've done all the troubleshooting, used different powers, played with power management settings, but nothing seems to work. I should have invested in a more expensive hard drive, perhaps an SSD."
3046,1,Failed after 15 months,After 15 months the disk became unusable
3047,5,In use,Use this for my external storage on my xbox and it works just got a watch a YouTube video on how to get my games on it and you know it did it it works
3048,4,It works on a mac!Follow these directions,"I see all of the reviews saying it won't work on a Mac.That's not true.You do need to open Disk Utility on your mac to format it correctly.At the top of your computer, Go>Utilities>Disk Utility.Find the Seagate Portable disk on the left.If you expand it by clicking the arrow, you will see two.Select the top Seagate and click erase on the top middle of Disk Utility.Choose a name for the disk after it is erased i.e. iTunes, fam vids, etc.Format will be Mac OS Extended (Journaled).Scheme will be GUID Partition Map.Now click Erase, and it will be formatted for a Mac.Yes, it would have been nice to write this on the piece of paper in the box to avoid lots of headaches."
3049,5,Recommended by Computer Techs.,"I was having my computer attended to by a professional computer tech person, and he personally recommended this Seagate External Hard Drive as a good option to fix my problem, which was ""no additional disk space"".Can't get much better than that!"
3050,5,JUST PERFECT👌🏽,The media could not be loaded.
3051,5,Such a great find!,Able to download tons of content onto this drive as opposed to my laptops few GBs. Feel so free as opposed to prior to purchasing when I had to pick and choose what files to keep. The price was amazing as well. Site where I purchased my rig was charging 4x this!
3052,5,External hard drive Not in this order. Apologies Hard drive found inside pack thrown out in trash.?,I received Lifewater and a USB cord but no external hard drive in the order..
3053,1,ALMOST lasted a single year,"I bought this external hard drive (1TB) in March of 2021. It is late January of 2022 and completely out of the blue, it completely crapped out. I've had multiple tech people hop into my computer and they all said the hard drive is fried. It won't connect and can't be opened no matter what they tried. So now all 500 GB of data on the hard drive is lost for good. It can't be extracted. So much information, gone, not even a year after purchase. One of the tech companies told me to never purchase a USB hard drive ever again because this is a frequent issue. It might work initially, but then it will randomly break and you will lose everything and not have any way to get it back. Disappointing, but lesson learned. Don't risk your data. Learn from my mistakes. This is a massive disappointment."
3054,5,You can never go wrong with a Seagate brand!,"You can never go wrong with a Seagate brand. Always reliable, always priced right!"
3055,5,works fast,works as advertized
3056,3,Poor connection design,"This is a decent USB hard drive. It is a little noisy compared to others I have, but not the noisiest and well under tolerable. I use it for Time Machine backup. It works great for this.My only complaint is the connection. The cable connects to the hard drive via Micro-B usb. It hardly stays in and is easily disconnected with the slightest movement. I am not sure if I have a crappy one or this is common. However, I have found this type of connection issue is common with Micro-B connectors. For this reason alone, I could not recommend it.Otherwise, it would be a great USB hard drive for the capacity and price."
3057,2,Hard drive failed within six months,It was very disappointing to have this hard drive fail so quickly... I recommend spending a bit more money to get a higher quality product.
3058,5,Great!,Works great! Bang for your buck! Comes with usb cord needed! I put all my games and run them on this! Doesn’t feel like a cheap product !
3059,3,Don’t buy if you have Xbox series s/x,Doesn’t work on next gen consoles don’t waste your time
3060,5,Simple to use,I was surprised by the small profile of this hard drive. I am able to take all of my files with me rather than carry around my computer. So far it has shown itself to be reliable.
3061,1,I dropped it once and it broke.,Absolutely horrible! All my files are lost. I dropped it once and it broke.
3062,5,Excellent Hardrive,Seagate is the Cadillac of external hard drives and computer related equipment.This one is no exception
3063,1,Didn’t work,I had saved this to take to a repair shop with my computer. They found that it didn’t work. It had been a bit past the return date.
3064,5,Great Operation,Worked as advertised. Have since ordered another!
3065,3,Disappointing,The description for this external HDis misleading because the cable supplied does NOT use a USB3.0 connection. I'm disappointed because it requires plugging into a hub adaptor for it to work with a newer Mac that only has USB3.0 ports.
3066,5,very good!,easy to use
3067,5,Good for backing up cloud data,Storing purchased lectures on it. Having no problems.
3068,1,Haven’t used it one time without a problem,As a professional photographer I need an external hd for backing up photos. EVERY TIME I’ve tried to download over 30-35 files it stops working.Not worth the money.
3069,5,Great Portable Druve,"As a professional photographer, I often have to save images on location. This drive fits easily in my gear bag and can transfer between camera, laptop and desktop computer. Beats the hell out of having multiple SD cards."
3070,5,Works great,Very simple to hook up and works great
3071,1,It broke,I dislike that it broke in between travel which means it's portability is absolutely terrible.
3072,5,Auxiliary hard drive,"I made this purchase with mixed expectations.I readseveral reviews about using this equipment and it's compatibility with Dish!After reviewing the criteria for adding a storage device to my Dish system, I took a chance.I also Googled the difference between a USB-3 and a USB-2.The USB-3 can handle faster data than a USB-2 (meaning if requirements indicate a USB-3, it has to be a USB-3!However, if a USB-2 required, the USB-3 will work).My Dish system is the latest Hopper-3/with Sling and this equipment is perfectly compatible, no hitch, just plug in and enjoy!"
3073,5,Great product for a ps5 and cheap to by since no playstation logo,I like this product because its a know good brand and is cheaper because it doesn't have a playstation than the other that's a bit more expensive anf it works perfectly with my ps5
3074,5,Buen producto,"Cumple con las especificaciones, y buen producto"
3075,5,What you would expect,"It's what you would expect from a drive...do not drop this or it will break. Also be careful with the port. I think if you plug/unplug this thing 1000 times, you might have a problem, so be gentle..."
3076,5,A bit noisy most of the time. Overall it's good.,What I didn't like about this one is the fact that it's a little noisy and makes a thumping sound most of the time when it's working. I've had no problems playing most games with it and it's got excellent storage capacity. I've had it over a year now hooked into USB 3.0 and it's still going strong.
3077,1,Save yourself the trouble,"Save yourself the trouble and don't get this external drive. I've never written a review before, but this is a PSA: I owned this drive for 11 months, only used it a handful of times, mainly for uploading about 10,000 photos from 2014-2018. One day, it stopped working. It became unreadable. Now, I have to pay at least $700 to get my photos back from a data retrieval company. They said the disk was extremely scratched, and it looked like it had suffered an impact. I have never dropped it or even handled it roughly. Save yourself the time and money -- don't buy this one!"
3078,4,Like and dislike,Love the storage and price was descent. Transfer rate is alot slower than i expected.
3079,5,Haven't used it enough.,Haven't used it enough
3080,5,Almacenamiento,Perfecto
3081,5,Buen producto,El disco lo he utilizado para edición de videos en 4k en premiere pro y ha funcionado bien.
3082,5,Good storage,Good quality
3083,2,I paid full price for a used product!,I got a used product with someone else's photos on it.There was no packaging it was just loose in the box with the cord attachedand a manual tossed in.I really needed to get stuff off my kids computer so she could use it for school.Extremely disappointed.No integrity.
3084,5,Expanded storage.,It was a gift and Gamer loves it.
3085,5,Handy to have.,This is a great external hard drive! I bought it to help speed up my laptop and store (mainly) pictures. The cord is too short for me but using it until I get a longer one.
3086,1,Dead after 1 week,"purchased the drive as a gift for astudent and it died after one weeks use.Unfortunately, he told me after he threw it out."
3087,1,Do not buy! Do not waste your money!,"Two months after I bought this brand new drive it crashed. I contacted the manufacture and sent in the drive which of course took over a month for them to tell me they couldn’t recover anything. I barely had enough film footage on the drive to fill it, so I never understood what made it crash. Of course, I never got any type of explanation.It also took them over a month to send a replacement drive which will not format to my MacBook. Such a joke."
3088,4,Like it but wished,I bought this to back up photos. It does but not easily and I keep getting a pop-up which is quite annoying to buy Adobe Photo Software. It onlypops up when I have this plugged in.
3089,4,Always reliable products,Great BIG capacity allows me to keep copies of all my fav TV shows
3090,5,My son loves this for his Xbox x,Bought this for my son to use with his Xbox x. Seems like he never has enough room for storing his games. When he visits his dad he takes his hard drive with him. It's durable and a very portable size.
3091,5,Works great for my ps4.,Works great for my ps4.
3092,5,None,None
3093,1,Useless,"Product does connect to the XBOX but it is very difficult to set up and does not work after turning XBOX off. I do not recommend it at all, it is a waste of money."
3094,5,Works great! Better than the WD,"After having a Western Digital Elements fail me and I switched my apple plan to a family plan and realized I then ran out of space, I bought one of these from a local store and had it delivered. It hasn't failed me yet. I still use another online backup service, but this works great. I'm going to get one for time machine and another for movie and podcast storage. Data is such a crazy thing these days!"
3095,1,stopped working after a couple months,"bought this, transferred my data, i was excited,2 months later, it stopped working,waste of money,just pay extra and get better ones.i have a WD that ive had for like 12 years 500gb and stilll works perfectly."
3096,1,Turns off and on constantly,"The first one I bought turned off and on constantly and caused my programs to close in the middle of working on them. So I exchanged it and the second one started doing the same thing after around a month. It stores the data if you manage to save to it before it turns off, but good luck retrieving that data afterwards."
3097,1,Customer Support seems to be a FAQ list,"I just plugged in my brand new 8TB Seagate drive. I clicked on Start_Here_Mac and got this error message: You can't open ""Start_Here_MAc"" because it may be damaged or incomplete. I went to Seagate.com to find help and all I can find is an FAQ list. Extremely frustrating."
3098,1,Slow write speed,I was amazed at how long it was. Returning.
3099,5,Cumple su objetivo,Buen disco buena marca llegó sin problemas aún no le coloco información pero el pc lo reconoció perctamente hasta ahora no hay problemas
3100,1,DIED FIRST DAY,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . I GOT STUCK HALF WAY THRU MY STUFF AND BLAM.....THE SUCKER DIED AND REMAINS DEAD.DO NOT BUY.DO NOT BUY....
3101,5,Works perfectly with my XBOX ONE.,"Easy to use and setup as have all seagate products I have used over the years. Even though this product says it’s for computer use, I have no issues using it as extra hard drive space for my Xbox One. Would definitely recommend."
3102,5,Always useful,Great storage option!
3103,5,NOT 2.0T FOR XBOX,It only has 1.8T for Xbox not 2.0T
3104,5,Excellent product for ps4,Go to settings then devices then format click on format then your finished
3105,5,pocket size,"i have this little thing hooked to my ps4, it has all my games on it, and its super easy for transport heck it fits in my pocket. great storage with no problems."
3106,1,No,"You need to down load a file in order to use it.BUT, you have to agree with their TOS before you do.Anytime a TOS reserves the right to change the TOS without notice is a problem.I'm going to have to jailbreak it.I shouldn't have to."
3107,1,"Broke after 1 year, 1 month","Used for Xbox One. Great drive until it just up and stopped working one day, one month after the 1 year rescue plan expired. Buyer beware..."
3108,4,Consider how many pics you may have in deciding storage capacity. You may need more than the 2 tb,So far its great :small and appears fast with ease to use.
3109,5,You get what you buy,If you're looking for a good price and a reliable storage product? Buy this. Nothing to complain about. The 3.0 USB is fast also.
3110,1,Failed after 5 months and less than 30 hours of use.,Not happy.Senate has historically been a great brand.Very surprised when it was no longer recognized by my computer.Put on another computer and checked device settings.Showed it was okay but it would not be recognized on the files list.Power light never came on.Ordered aToshiba as a replacement.Will find out if Segate will replace it.
3111,3,Recovery isn't possible,I am unable to recover what was backed up...
3112,1,Tech support is terrible,Drive kept crashing after 6 months use. Sent it back for data recovery. That was great service. Never received my original replacement drive. Have sent emails and contacted support on their website. No luck.
3113,5,Great product,Works great with PS5 no problems so far and storage amount is amazing
3114,4,Little noisy but great otherwise,"When I first plugged it in, I noticed it was a little louder than a HDD in an external case.I had no issues that others had with write speed, I am using it as a Time Machine backup and am only at 1.3 tb used of 5.Time may tell whether it slows as it fills, but it backed up overnight with no issues."
3115,5,nice,nice
3116,5,Funciona muy bien!,Todo bien hasta el momento!
3117,1,Not Reliable,"Wanted to buy a bigger portable hard drive, got this Seagate Portable 2TB, after 18 months started to have problems with the hard drive, till it eventually died.tech support didn't do too much ( after I provided everything they wanted ). all and all not reliable, there are better hard drives out there."
3118,5,So far so good!,"Managed to transfer all the files I needed to plus tons of extra space still available, in order to clean up an old full laptop"
3119,1,Stopped working after a few months 💀,Worked amazing for a few months and one day o come back from school turn on my ps4 and now it won’t turn on even tho it shows up as storage on my ps4 and when I try to format it on my ps4 it just loads then says it wont work also there’s this weird beeping sound
3120,5,Great product!,"Trusted name, amazing support, ease of use, what's not to like?"
3121,1,quality,Not worth it. Only used twice and its broken!!!!
3122,5,Exactly as advertised,"You'll get what you paid for, exactly as it is described.Easy to use.Works like a charm. The price is right.What more can you ask for.?"
3123,4,Dont expect plug and play,Set up didnt launch when i plugged jt in.I had to go to file manger and find the setup.Expected more
3124,5,Awesome,Works on my Mac and Pc and i was able to format it so itwould be interchangeable between to two!!! Perfect.
3125,5,Portable,"So far, I have not had any problems. I've only been using it for about 4 weeks. I purchased the extra protection and hopefully won't ever need to use it."
3126,5,More than expected,"The one I bought was used, so I was a little afraid while buying it, however, far better than I expected, good wraping, the description said it had some cosmetic imperfections bigger that 1'', but there was not any imperfection on it, the only difference between a new one and this one was the box."
3127,5,Good value and just what I needed,My old backup drive not the dust so I needed something to make sure I could have a time machine backup for my mac. This one has great capacity and was affordable. It’s small and light weight.
3128,5,Very good backup for shadow copies of a small desktops Windows 10,Very good backup for shadow copies of a small desktops Windows 10
3129,5,It sure is 2 TB,Need 2 TB? This is 2 TB
3130,5,It works will with my computer!,It works will with my computer!
3131,3,Looks like misrepresentation taking place here.....,"The unit seems to be well constructed and has performed as expected for my initial back-ups.This unit is represented as a 12TB External Hard Drive.All indications I have been able to see show that this is a 10.9 TB unit, meaning that the reality is more than 1 Terrabyte less than expected and paid for.Since I am dealing with close margins, this is truly a disappointment and inconvenience.PLEASE, Vendor, advertise truth for the consumer!"
3132,5,Easy to apply,This was the first and currently only external storage that I have needed for my ps4. I needed it because the ps4 starting storage was not enough for even 3 games so with this it solved all my problems and was able to keep all my games saved whenever I needed it and never corrupted my storage.
3133,1,No longer works,Stopped working after a year of use. Disappointed
3134,5,Nice but no case,Huge storage. Cheaper than Best Buy stores.
3135,5,Great and easy. Just plug in usb port,Easy to useand
3136,5,Works good on ps5,Works good on the ps5
3137,5,Awesome,"Works perfectly for my Xbox one, literally just plug n play"
3138,1,Painfully slow!,"I have 2 maxed out hard drives that literally out perform this.Not SSHD, regular HDs 3 years old, maxed out that still run faster than this.Returned for a refund"
3139,5,Very pleased with product,"It serves the purpose for storage, very pleased"
3140,5,Works Perfectly,Easy to set up and works great
3141,5,excelente,funciona bien ps5
3142,5,Worksgreat.,Exactly as advertised. I use it for storage of photos.
3143,4,Good storage capacity and backup software,"I am quite pleased with this drive. The storage capacity should last me quite a while. But, I especially like the automatic back ups. Just keep it plugged in and it does differential back ups every five minutes or so. I would definitely buy it again."
3144,5,Love it!,"I have one for myself, and bought one for my boyfriend as he kept deleting games to install new ones on his Xbox One. We both love it, a lot of space, way better than Xbox base storage."
3145,5,Working Great,Absolutely no complaints.An excellent product.
3146,5,Excellent,What's to say Not a lot of money and a quality product
3147,2,Goes bad in 2 years,"I use mine for an Xbox and this will be my third one. You’d think the build quality would be better but I hear some beepish noises and then it shuts off, same thing as the first one."
3148,5,Works great!,I’ve ordered probably a half dozen of these and the work great!
3149,5,Great product. Easy to use.,Great product. Well packaged. Very easy to use and great capacity. Exactly what I needed. Small item with large storage capacity. Perfect for what I needed for my designer files storage that where to large for the server. Great buy
3150,5,Great for shucking,"The 2TB model houses a normal 2.5"" ST2000LM007 drive. I made quick use of it by upgrading my Xbox One X internal drive with it."
3151,5,"Just a great, reliable backup.","Just a great, reliable backup."
3152,5,Seagate is second only to Ausus hard drives they are the best hard drives you can ever get...,It is number 2 on the list of drives to buy ausus is the best but Seagate is second best and for the money you can't go wrong...
3153,1,"My last one died right after setting this up, not sure if its related..",Storage and working off of.
3154,3,Be careful with cors.,Cord that came with drive did not work. I had to use a cord I happened to have in hand.
3155,5,"Lots of storage, easy to use","Good price, lots of room to organize and archive files. Extremely fast, nice addition to my drive collection, ready to copy and eliminate smaller drives."
3156,5,Awesome product.Exactly as advertised,Nhhhj
3157,5,Perfect external hard drive!,I’m very happy with my purchase. So simple to use and great amount of storage!!!
3158,5,It was a good purchase.,"It was a good value for the money when I bought it. If you're reading this in 2099, you're probably laughing that 1TB was even a thing. You're also probably trying to build a time machine to escape the alien race that has enslaved you. (This guy is crazy) Then the realization dawns maybe he's a time traveler...Shout out to my boi Quaddius Platt- we did it bro. I just hope you find this message in time."
3159,1,Never Buy This Item,"Please do yourself a favor and pick something else.This drive is extremely slow.That may be reason enough, but the worse part is:while I have owned it for about 8 months, I have used it maybe 6 times for offloading data as an archive.Well, now it is completely dead!the drive has been sitting on my desk, unplugged, nice and comfy.Seagate is not not the company that it used to be.BEWARE!"
3160,5,Works fine,I bought this for my PS4 and honestly it works fine
3161,5,Works perfectly,"I was impressed with the coast of this unit and its size. I had paid higher for fewer quality products. However, I am very pleased with this Portable HHD."
3162,5,Perfecto,"Completo, el perfecto complemento para una laptop con poco almacenamiento."
3163,3,Don't want the external drive software connected to the Internet,I suppose the external drive works well. I just don't want the external drive software connected to the Internet collecting data through cookie tracking.
3164,5,Drive is everything that it was advertised as.,I like the speed of the drive and the ability to set it up for use on both macs and pc machines.
3165,5,It does what you need,Seems good quality for the price.
3166,2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY/ WONT STAND TIME.,The product won't hold up against time. The device will only work if the chord or device is laying a certain way... I've only have it for maybe about a year. It was not worth the money.
3167,4,Capacity,Huge capacity. Used for over the air DVR recordings
3168,2,Customer Service,"If you have an issue with the product, dealing with Customer Support is very time consuming.Our unit quit working.It was still under warranty.I spent close to 2 hours working with Customer Support to get a replacement.You have to pay shipping on the device to return. They also wanted me to return the device fully intact.It was not responding so I could not delete data on drive.I had to fight to be able to destroy the data storage so their company did not have access to what I had stored on the device.I had to get ""special permission"" to destroy the drive before I returned it.I would not purchase any product from this company.Even though the support representative assured me that the data on my device would be 100% secure and protected their own Warranty statements indicates that your product may be sent to countries where protection of data may not be the same.Directly from their warranty statement ""By returning your product to Seagate, you agree to the Seagate repair process as described in the Seagate Return Policy, including the transfer of your data to countries that may not offer the same level of data protection as your home country, as well as the deletion of your data."""
3169,5,Excellent,This product is great
3170,1,Did Not Work - Terrible Customer Service,I bought this to back up files on my Chromebook and free up space on Google Drive. It connected to my Chromebook but could not copy files that were not PDF format. I tried to chat with the company customer/technical support and they basically told me I had to go to Chromebook support for help. Very frustrating and not what I need. I will get something else that is more user-friendly and compatible with the Chromebook. I cannot recommend for Chrome OS users -- cannot speak to how it works for other users. But I am frustrated. Hoping I can return it!
3171,2,Makes a grinding noise.,"The media could not be loaded. I would easily give this product a 5 star review if it wasn't making a grinding noise. I looked it up and supposedly it's from some type of ""head crash"" or something. I never dropped it once. So either there's something wrong with the hard drive and it got dropped on the way over here, or it's just a noisy hard drive. I just really hope somewhere down the road, all of my data doesn't become corrupted because of it. Grinding is not a good noise when it comes to External Hard Drives. Apparently there are some other noises that are typical for EHD's, but not grinding. This is just me, but I would stay away from this product until further notice."
3172,5,Great!,Great for the price
3173,3,Lots of storage but at a cost.,"I bought this drive for archival purposes since my old trusty 1TB drive was running out of space all the time and I just needed more. At first, the drive performed well with high read/write speeds.After just a few days, the drive started to thermal throttle when writing multiple consecutive large files.I'm hoping when I get through transferring all the data I need to the device that it won't give me any more issues."
3174,5,"Amazing product, room for tons of games",Perfect reliable
3175,5,A great hard drive all around!,"I love seagate because they are not only affordable, but from my personal experience, they are also rather reliable. I left the tech support part of the review blank, because I didn't need their support. It was very easy plug and play set up. My windows 10 computer recognized it immediately, and automatically set it up on it's own. I have been able to run some very intense (and very large) games on it with ease. no stuttering of the frame rate or anything. Nice and smooth. I upgraded from the 1tb external version of this same hard drive, and so far, I haven't had any issues with it at all, and I'm already well over 1TB in used space on it. You DO lose about half a TB of space for the drive's ability to function quickly. (externals often have a portion of the hard drive they use to maintain the drive's speed and efficiency. The larger the portion, the more smoothly it runs from my experience) and with half a TB reserved for this, it runs very smoothly. I still have 4.5tb to work with, so...that is more than enough for the average person. All in all...a very solid hard drive."
3176,2,Does not work on Mac OS Monterey,"I found a forum with several others with same problem who have Mac OS Monterey, basically, it can be accomplished, but it's a PITA,so I will have to return this"
3177,1,Very bad,"Please don’t waste your money on this product, after a few months of using I had so many games that I bought and saved on there, it erased everything, so now I can’t play any of them until I get a better one! Very disappointed"
3178,4,"Seagate Portable 5TB,beware the USB cable","It works,but when I use the cable with in the package,it got unstable write speed range from few KB to 60MThen I swap the USB cable from my old portable hard drive,now it can run stable about 80MB/S.You might need another PREMUIM USB cable before you buy this."
3179,4,"light, compact, good storage and value","Works as it should but needs to be plugged directly into computer, cannot go into a hub device"
3180,5,Great if you need extra storage on your PlayStation,Great device if you need extra storage on your PlayStation.I gave one to my son who had no more room on his PS4 and he was able to move everything over and install new games once’s again.Well worth price
3181,5,Great product works fine.,"This is great for PCs that are out of space. Move vidoes, music and pictures to it freed up lots of room."
3182,5,Great for my PS4,This portable storage works great with my PS4! Everything formatted automatically with no trouble.
3183,5,Excellent,So happy I got this because my other one started making weird noises and I was afraid it was going to die. Then I found this and it has been so great and I transferred over all of my files from the old one with no problem.
3184,5,integrity,has good storage space . will be able to hold all my music and videos.
3185,5,Its a hardrive alright,Wish the cord that came with it was longer but it gets the job done
3186,5,So far so good,This product was a gift. I know the capacity is great because I have one myself and it's easy to transport around/ travel with.
3187,5,Awsome used SSD!,"I love this ssd.Inexpensive, used, delivered early.Works perfectly."
3188,5,excellent portable drive,"It is extremely compact and well built. 2TB is sufficient in these days and transfer speeds are not great but not terrible.It doesn't heat up which is great. Overall, this is an excellent backup drive."
3189,5,Works with old ps4,"Did exactly what it was supposed to, works well with my first generation ps4 and I went from 4 games to about 20 with room for more. 5 stars."
3190,3,Did work the way i wanted it too.,I bought this device to use it for my ps5 and was under the impression i could store ps5 games on it and i was mistaken. I can only store ps4 games on external hard drives with the ps5.
3191,2,Doesn't last long,"Bought the hard drive to use as backup storage.After only one-and-a-half years, the damn thing burned out and cannot be accessed by the system.Piece of crap -- do not purchase."
3192,1,Glitched/Faulty,I lost video files on this drive. Loss of much money for a video shoot in losing footage. Never will go with Seagate again.
3193,4,Not exactly 1TB…,"The hard isn’t that exactly 1 TB. The storage is closer to 900 GB than 1 TB. But that’s fine with me it’s still over 900 GB and enough storage for me. Recommend is you don’t mind it having less than 1 TB. Also, you can’t do a full system back aka entire system backup. Though that might just be me."
3194,5,Great little USB Harddrive,This one is the greatest.
3195,5,Product works fine in terms of everything,"Product works fine in terms of everything, using it on my Xbox for gaming and I have problems, a Must buy for me❤"
3196,5,It's a great hard drive so far,"All my information transferred to HD no problem.To early to tell otherwise.It's a good brand,I'll stay positive"
3197,5,Great for the price,Should have bought one years ago
3198,1,Didn't work,Try three computers wouldn't show up on any of them (as drive) plus tried to format it and it wouldn't let me
3199,1,No password!,It doesn’t get any password
3200,5,Un muy buen producto,"Es confiable, rápido, no tiene ningùn problema de capacidad y además luce bien junto a mi computadora."
3201,5,Only first time use but great so far!,Great so far.
3202,5,Great,Great product
3203,4,1.8 TB not a whole 2,So far it works well and I've downloaded games to it from my Xbox one. The 4 stars is because it wasn't a whole 2 TB. Every bit of the memory I pay for matters because that could have been a few more games I could have downloaded. Other than that it's good
3204,5,So far so good,"Using this little guy to hold my media library.No bad sectors or the like, but only been using it a short while.The true test will be it's longevity."
3205,1,Don't waste your money. Absolute garbage!,Stopped working completely. Bought a new cord and it turned on but will not connect. Then it disconnects. Can't access any of my documents.
3206,5,Simple external usb BUT,"This is a device that you’d buy if you have a console, laptop, or device with a USB port that just needs an extra boost in storage. The reliability of these seagate pods are A+, and unless you’ve blasted the base of the device with a shot gun- it will work. Technically not water proof, but I use these bulky awkward devices as coasters for my desk. 10/10 would use as a self defense weapon"
3207,5,Buena,Hasta ahorita a funcionado bien y rápido
3208,5,portabilidad,excelente solución
3209,5,Great,Works well!
3210,5,Worth every Penny,"Literally plug and play! Windows 10 or 11 picked it up a second after I plugged it in and it has worked flawless. Using to store games from steam, Xbox games pass, Eaplay Pro on my laptop Razor 15 rtx3080 i711800."
3211,2,Not a great product.,"I bought 2 of these, 1 2tb and the other 4tb. Both of them within a month started to give me strange problems. One of them, if connected to my computer but not actively being used, after a while it will essentially lock my computer. I would not be capable of ejecting the drive, if I tried to open the drive during this time period everything just freezes, and the taskbar disappears, screen goes black, the only way to get it to stop is to pull it out of the computer. Once I do that, like magic, everything starts to work normally, very strange. The other one takes too long to do anything, while suddenly starting to have the same issues as the other hard drive, although to a lesser degree. I'm just not happy overall, and will not be buying a seagate hard drive any time soon."
3212,4,Installed easily,Just what I needed. Lots of storage.
3213,5,nice capacity drive - used as time machine for a mac,My last drive has finally started to fill up.I'm using it for a Time machine back for a mac running Monterey. Formatted as APFS and works as expected.The special end that plugs into the drive means that I better not loose the cable!Good stuff.
3214,1,Doesnt connect to my Razer laptop,They send a replacement and still didn't work
3215,5,Excellent,"Compact, fast, USB powered."
3216,5,unit works great and is very portable for gaming with friends,used for extra storage for ps5
3217,5,Great product,Love the product. Just what I needed
3218,2,No Two Drives are the same!,"I know this is a late review. But I purchased two Seagate drives at the same time, both 8TB back in 2020. One is used for my Xbox One and the other is used for my former PS4. Never had any issues with the drive that was used all the time for the Xbox One. The PS4 I would have random issues. Just assumed it was the PS4.I sold my PS4 off and I had this drive laying around. I plugged it into my laptop to format it. It failed the formatting. I plugged it into my Xbox Series S, then I heard the sound that no one wants to ever hear. The grinding, the heads on the drive are bad, on the drive that was barely ever used. Heads up."
3219,5,Works perfectly! Love it.,The media could not be loaded. Be aware that you have to move optimized games for series s/x onto internal storage but is quick to do.
3220,5,price,Great price .
3221,1,I’m Really Disappointed,I have been waiting to buy to this items. Got this item after 3-4 days. Great! Opened with excitement and followed directions. Did not work the first time on my MacBook Air storage. Tried 5 times and still nothing was transferred or helped free up my laptop. Tonight (EST) Imma try again and then I’ll call Seagate for assistance. I like to try before annoying customer service. So I hope this works because I’ve heard how great this product is from a family member and a coworker.
3222,5,Perfect,Worked perfect for my PS4. Just plug and play. Now all my sons and all my games can fit without having to decide what to get rid of to make room. Transferred all my games to this drive off the PS4’s main HD.
3223,1,Could not get it to work,Product would only beep at me after the initial setup. Could not move over any data. Avoid this product it will stop working on you eventually but I had no idea it would stop on the second use.
3224,5,Muy bueno,Buena capacidad y velocidad de almacenamiento
3225,4,Backup,Easy to use
3226,5,Returnedbecause not needed,"Returned,not needed"
3227,5,Muy buena relación precio - valor,"Excelente producto, con la capacidad de almacenamiento necesaria para lo que requiero y la mejor relación precio valor."
3228,5,easy to used,works good in my ps4
3229,5,Good but what about the original box,"So is perfectly working ,but it came with a different box than the original, at least is what i saw"
3230,4,Good for Xbox,It is a good way to have many games in you console unless you have one of the new console that needs faster storage but otherwise it’s good
3231,5,Great Buy,easy to use
3232,1,Doesnt work with MacBook Pro 2015 :(,"I bought this product assuming it would be easy to set up. I have a 2015 Macbook Pro, 15-inc, 2.5 GHz i7, 16GB ram, 500 GB hard drive. I've only used SeaGate external hard drives for my entire existence.So you can imagine how bummed I was to get the attached defective product notice in my Mac OS when I tried to open the installation software.Assuming they don't respond within 24-72 hours I am just going to move on to a different company and see if I can get better product support elsewhere."
3233,5,"It's a Seagate, I have zero complaints.","I've used Seagate drives as long as I can remember.I bought this for a Mac.It has to be reformatted but that's no big deal. I bought a 2TB and a 4TB and both are connected to my Mac.I use the 2TB for my Time Machine back ups.I use the 4TB for everything else. Other than reformatting, they are plug and play.I like this size and they are very portable.I put them in a protective case when I carry them.Strongly recommend this drive."
3234,5,Very good,Bought this for my boyfriends and my Xbox. We kept having to delete games in ordered to update others. This has saved us. We got the 2TB hard drive and it is very compact. The only downside is due to its own internal operating system its not 2TB but about 1.8TB other than that everything is amazing!
3235,1,Absolute junk DO NOT BUY,Only had it for a week or so and now it’s sitting here buzzing and doesn’t work. I had just backed everything up. Total junk I really used to think so highly of seagate.
3236,5,Very good storage and easily portable,The extended storage worked well for my ps5 and is very small and perfect to hide it.
3237,5,Great Hard Drive,This hard drive is super portable and holds exactly the space as advertised. It's easy to use and allows me to backup all my videos and photos to one device.
3238,5,Good Value,Easy to install and lots of memory for the right price
3239,5,Works great,Works great for needing more storage especially with a son who wants a lot of games!!
3240,5,Grandson loved it,Grandson loved it
3241,5,Perfect,"It has 1.8 tb for me but its perfect, alot smaller then i expected and fast"
3242,5,Easy to set up,"This helped me out a lot with my ps5. I had used up all my storage and needed extra space for more games and I didn’t want to deleted the games I already had. With this extra storage, I now have 5tb of extra space so now I don’t have to worry about running out. It’s super easy to use and set up. For ps5, just plug it into the USB port in the back and go to settings on your ps5 and format it. Then you’re ready to enjoy your extra storage space."
3243,1,Keeps crashing and shutting laptop down,"I saw all the great reviews and thought this would be a very good buy. I don't know if I have a bad one or not, but it keeps crashing and shutting my laptop down. I do not recommend based of my experiences. I will be returning this product."
3244,5,One of the best hard drives I’ve bought,I’ve bought other hard drives but nothing compares to this one for the price. It’s reliable & small enough to travel with while I work.
3245,3,i/o error messages from the jump,"I received the drive this morning, 1/15/22. After opening the package and plugging the drive into my PC, I began to back up some files, and a few seconds in received an i/o device error message. I canceled and restarted the operation, again, another i/o device error message. I checked my cables and rebooted my PC and made a third attempt but I still received the same error message. I then went to the Seagate website to download any drivers/firmware available for the drive but Seagate didn't recognize the S/N I entered, no S/N = no firmware. I instead downloaded Sea Tools and ran all available tests, both short and long generic tests failed. I then clicked on the Sea Tools driver information and noticed the S/N on the box doesn't match the S/N on the drive itself. At that point, I decided I'm not taking any chances.I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement. Hopefully, the new drive will function properly or I'll request a refund and try a different manufacturer.Update 1/23/22: I received a replacement drive and so far it's been operating smoothly. I'm upgrading my rating to 3 stars but will return in a few months to offer any final praise or criticism."
3246,1,WARNING: No Mac Friendly,It is not letting me use the drive. I can't make new folders or put files on it. I think I have to take a long time updating my mac just use this drive. I don't recommend this.
3247,5,Very easy plug and go...lets me get backup of items I want ASAP,"Just plugged in and was able to do backup of anything I wanted except of course things not allowed. Love it being outside of the pc, no taking it apart and adding it inside, not intrusion of the computer and able to take alone with me if have things to take to someone else without a lot of hassle.Very fast except of course of files that are huge, but that should be expected."
3248,5,Good… beware the cord,"I absolutely love my external hard drive. The only thing is that it’s a good idea to get a different, higher quality cord than the one it comes with. It also hums fairly noticeably when running a big game but that’s to be expected. Other than the cord, totally worth your money."
3249,5,Great deal in comparison,Not fully 2tb but in comparison to price of name brand u can’t beat these for the money
3250,2,Slow and noisy,"I use external hard drives primarily for video editing using FInal Cut Pro so that I do not fill up my iMac Pro desktop hard drive quickly. My last compact portable Seagate took about a year to fill up 5T. I store my libraries on this drive. I normally have purchased more compact Seagate drives such as this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VS8QCXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1IWhen I receive this Seagate Expansion HDD drive it was much larger than the others. It requires its own power source which the others I have used do not. It is noisy, and it is slow!It takes forever for videos to render and process.I've re-ordered the one I have gotten before, which I never had any trouble with. I don't know what the advantage is for nonportable over portable but it was certainly not speed.It runs in the background even when I am not using it. Maybe I need to format it or do something I am not aware of, but I am going back to the portable Seagates. There is no comparison!"
3251,5,Fast and reliable for PS4,"Small, fast and big, lots of capacity."
3252,5,Great product!!,I Like all the storage for my PS4 games.
3253,1,Bad product,This HD stopped working for no reason. Lost data on it.
3254,5,I followed a you tube tutorial on how to set up.Easy and I learned a lot.,Set this up on my Mac as a daily backup using time machine
3255,5,Great Storage,I liked the product because most other PS5 external hard drives are pricey and only carry GB. This one has excellent storage for the price and I am satisfied with this product overall.
3256,1,Will lead to data leakage to the manufacturer,"After using it for a few times, it can no longer be read, and my private data cannot be deleted in this hard drive. Returning it to Seagate,the Chinese manufacturer, will definitely cause my private data to leak to the Seagate."
3257,5,Great storage drive,Easy to use with almost endless capacity. Would purchase another one. Very easy to move large amounts of data from one computer to another.
3258,5,Very good,Every thing is good
3259,5,Easy to connect and use,Plugged it in and it was ready to go!
3260,5,Worked great,Easy to use works great
3261,5,Una gran velocidad y muy fácil de usar,"Esta marca la he usado por mucho tiempo y se ha ganado mi confianza. es increíble, muy rápido y fácil de usar."
3262,5,Awesome,Love it! A lot of storage for all my Games!
3263,5,As advertised,Decent price for product described
3264,3,Product not as expected,Says compatible with gaming but it doesn't work with the new Xbox.So was very disappointed
3265,2,Proprietary input port,"Has a proprietary input port with a supplied USB A cable. Now I have to purchase another cable and/or adapter just to make this hard drive useful or I’ll just return it. 21st century, Seagate."
3266,5,Great product for extra storage,Great storage device.
3267,5,Working great on my PS4,"I bought this to expand the storage of my PS4 and I have no complains at all, it has been working great so far with no issues."
3268,5,Awesome,Works like a dream
3269,5,Very Handy and Portable,Very durable little unit that holds a lot of data for the price.
3270,2,"Good at first, stopped working","bought in july of 2021, a few months later in November it just gave out. I tried getting a new cord, and reformatting it but nothing at all. its just dead. while it worked it was amazing"
3271,5,Gamers lively hood,External storage for an Xbox one. Excellent price. Easy to set up.
3272,5,Great,Works great
3273,5,Does the job!,Got this for working from home to keep work files separate from my personal computer and it works wonderfully!
3274,4,Does work with XBOX,This does work with XBOX.
3275,4,IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL,I like the drive I bought.I put all of my family pics on it to share with my granddaughter.But why should I rate this now?It is a month old!I will rerate it if it gets to 2 years without trouble.
3276,1,Came with broken configuration files,"Unable to set up on my macbook, as the mac file to configure the drive came unreadable and broken. Waste of time and money!"
3277,1,quit working,just stopped working after about 4 months
3278,5,Great choice for school,school files take up too much space on my computer and I’m tired of it so I got this. Now I can fill it with educational nonsense
3279,5,Excellent value for the price.,Works as it should
3280,5,Works good,"Nothing going wrong so far, use for storage for games on Xbox"
3281,2,Won't connect after a year and a half,"I purchased this drive 2 years ago in Jan 2020 to backup my MacBook Pro.The drive will no longer show up in my Finder when connected.I have tried several different cables and have even tried to connect it to my husband's MacBook.DiskUtility recognizes the drive so I tried using DiskUtility to erase the drive which gave me an error ""Couldn't open device"" (-69877).I'm frustrated that this $109 drive lasted less than 2 years."
3282,5,Great product,Works Great!
3283,1,Trash,Trash
3284,1,No tiene el almacenamiento correcto,Pague por un disco duro de 2TB y no me permite ingresar más archivos. Ni siquiera llega a 1TB su capacidad.
3285,5,Good for extra storage,"I got some of the latest games on it apex halo infinite, vanguard I even got gta v on it running no problem"
3286,1,Complete GARBAGE,"Usually you plug in the external hard drive to your computer and bam, the files show up in a window.Not here.The computer recognizes that there's an external hard drive, but i cannot see or open the files anywhere. The files are no where to be found.I read the possible solutions (using another cable, port, changing the letter of the drive)... all BS... nobody should have to do that. Any other external hard drive in the market you just need to plug it in and works. Not this one.Horrible. Just negative stars if I could."
3287,5,Great Capacity and drive,I don't know what there really is to say other then it works and 6 TB's for this price is a great deal!
3288,5,PS4 Backup drive… perfect!,Bought this as a backup drive for my PS4. I now have the space I need to download and run games.
3289,5,For my Xbox one,"I've had zero issues, in fact, worked great right out of the box! Finally, I have enough storage In can have all my games downloaded!"
3290,5,Great hard drive,Love this drive.Bought to store more games on my Xbox One S.Upgraded to the Xbox Series S and I still use it for the older games and will keep using them for that but I’m gonna have to get one of the new memory card looking devices.These mechanical drives aren’t fast enough for the new systems…Just fyi
3291,3,Hard with mac,"Worked ok with pc, terrible with mac- so frustrated I just gave up"
3292,5,The best part is it's SEAGATE!They literally have THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE;,Excellent price and world class customer service! I used to buy SanDisk but now I'm a cheerleader for Seagate for life! They are so easy to get ahold of if you have ANY questions they are happy to help! Enjoy the nice Chunk of storage 🙂 anything bigger you might as well upload to the cloud 🤷‍♀️
3293,5,bueno,bueno
3294,4,Affordable,"Great product great price, sometimes its needs to be unplugged and reconnected when connected to a constant device."
3295,5,Easy to set up,I purchased 2...one for my son who has a Xbox one s and my other son who has a PS4. My son's are 9 and 10 years old. It was so easy for them to set up by themselves without any help.
3296,2,Corrupted files after 2 years,"It was working fine, but now my files have started to get corrupted and I can not recover my files :( An entire years worth of videos, photos and content are now inaccessible..."
3297,1,Does not work for Mac!,We opened it up and it said it doesn't work for Mac.
3298,5,"For as long as I've had it, it's been fantastic! (Used with PS4 slim)","I Got this little device because we needed more storage for the playstation 4. Plugged it in, read how to format it to the ps4, and bing bang boom 4 terabytes of storage! We'll see how long it hold up."
3299,5,if i could give 10 i would,it i an amazing product
3300,5,Space saver,Like the slim design
3301,4,Exceeded my expectations!,"The size, product and ease of use unbelievable!"
3302,5,Lots of storage space the most I’ve ever seen.,"Really huge hard drive uses electricity to power, you need to plug this behemoth of a hard drive into the wall and then the device you’re using it on with a usb cord."
3303,5,Works great with PS4,Works great on my PS4
3304,5,WORKED for Playstation,"Been researching some hard drives that are compatible with the PS4. So far, this one is pretty great! it's been working well. The game does not hang when I used it as my extension for my new games. Got a great deal with this one too, because, in stores like Walmart or Target, they sell these for $10 or more. and at GameStop, they sell a 2 TB hard drive for PlayStation, Xbox, etc. but it's used. So might as well get this one and just wait for it to arrive. This one also includes a Data Recovery Plan (Data recovery service). The little pamphlet included in the box will show where to submit a claim in case your files get corrupted."
3305,5,Easy to use,Currently using this as a storage for my Xbox one and it was super simple to set it up
3306,1,It crashed within weeks,Don't buy this hard drive if video editing or using Macbook :-(
3307,1,Complete BS,"Received as a gift and only had 8.25 GB of storage.Having the gift giver return it for a full refund.Tech, cosmics & skin care should never be purchased on Amazon."
3308,5,Excelente!!,Excelente para el ps4 !!!
3309,5,It works,"This product works as intended. It's a hard drive, and it stores a terabyte of stuff, I can't ask for more"
3310,5,Used for PS4,Works great and formats itself. Easy to set up. Just plug in and follow the prompts on the PS4.
3311,1,Broke after less than 3 months,"I archived thousands of photos and videos from multiple laptops into this device, only to have it completely break on me (for NO reason, I never dropped it or spilled anything on it). For some reason, one day it just didn't want to open for me, and now I hear a beeping sound within the hardware. I looked it up and apparently it means the hardware is damaged and I lost EVERYTHING. I can't even begin to tell you how distressing that is. If we can't trust our external hard drives to secure our data, they are useless. This product can't even do the ONE thing it is supposed to do. Don't buy it."
3312,5,As described,Had a large amount of data to move when I retired! Worked great!
3313,5,Easy to install.... used on Xbox One,Great HD.Easy to hook up and installI went the cheaper router and got this instead of an SSD.very happy with my purchase
3314,5,Small footprint.Worked right away.,I plugged it in.It worked.No problems or issues.
3315,5,fast transfer of data,"It's light, portable and works very well"
3316,5,Easy use,My dish went out and in order to repair my dish they were going to have to uninstall my Hopper which meant I would have lost all of my recordings. So I purchased this external hard drive plugged it into my Hopper downloaded all my recordings and when they installed the new Hopper I just plugged it into the new Hopper and now I still have access to all my recordings. It was easy to use.
3317,5,Excelente ...!!!!!,Muy buena compra...!!!
3318,3,My mom had some minor issues.,When she got it she used it twice and most of the data was corrupted. She followed the steps for removing it as to avoid this very issue. She had to have me format it so she could use it again. So far she has not needed to use it for about a month or so. So I'm not sure if the issue is persistent or if it's a one off. Only time and use will tell.
3319,5,Seagate,Excellent product from Seagate as always.
3320,5,Christmas gift,"Christmas gift, they loved it"
3321,5,Great deal,Great deal on a large storage device.I had lots of files to backup and it worked great.
3322,4,Honestly,"First time with this brand , Works and easy to set up just plug it in, downloading is slow but that should be expected. One thing though is it dose not have the 5 terabyte’s I paid for but that is okay, I have bought one before for my ps4 and it was missing about 20% of its storage so if you need 2 terabytes go with a bigger one and it dosnt hurt to have a little exstra anyway. I will try to follow up after a week or so but as of know it is just fine."
3323,5,Llegó a tiempo y fue muy fácil de instalar.,"Lo compre para la PS4 de mi hijo.Fue muy fácil de instalar y tiene capacidad para mucho contenido. Es pequeña, no pesa y no ocupa espacio."
3324,5,Works perfectly,"Pretty much automatic installation- plug and play.A very useful addition to my Macbook Air.At one point it did not display on my computer-not sure why.After talking with Apple, we reformatted and reinstalled.No problems since."
3325,5,Exactly what I needed. Works great with PS5!,"Nice packaging, drive was nice and solid and worked perfectly with my PS5"
3326,5,Great buy!,Nice portable storage! Does the job!
3327,5,Perfect drive for saving off family photos and videos!,"Perfect sized drive to saving data, and moving it around. Usb 3.0 and fast!"
3328,5,Great Hard Drive and great $$$,The Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD is a great hard drive.Easy to use and fast transferring files.Really happy and satisfied.Good price too!
3329,5,easy to use,This is what I needed for a computer that is ready to die. Now I can have all my data and the computer can go away with no worries about lost files
3330,5,Great product,Overall great product. Decent price too
3331,5,Playstation storage,Bought it for my grandsons Playstation. Cabled it up and it works great.
3332,5,Great product,Easy setup plugged in my PS4 and that's all it took. Great product!
3333,5,creating memories,I like that I'm able to save more data for my games so now I won't have to worry about deleting anything now.
3334,5,cheap and good quality!,Great product for the price.
3335,1,Not what I expected,Does not work the way it says. Still have to purchase a memory card. And I thought this product was for memory
3336,5,Seems to work fine for the XBox S,Bought it for my daughter to use with her Xbox S. It cannot be used for Xbox S specific games but it works great with standard Xbox games
3337,1,stopped working after 6 months,"top writing speed is 40MB, stopped working after 6 months. Lost everything I shot for my youtube channel.VERY UNRELIABLE PRODUCT"
3338,5,works great for ps4,"plugged it in, hit format and instantly had another TB of storage for my ps4. Works perfeclty!"
3339,5,Price,It’s good
3340,1,It stopped working in the first month,It won't save a document or bring it back up
3341,1,DOESN’T WORK WITH PS5,I bought this hard drive so that I could download more games for my ps5 and I plugged it in in every port possible and it said “this device is not supported” the only merit I could give this thing is its portability
3342,1,Deffective junk.,"No matter what I tried the drive would randomly disconnect itself. A new cable, different port, disable sleep settings, disable USB suspension. And every time it disconnected, it would corrupt itself even if there was nothing running on it. I would have to run error checking 5 times a day. Even after 3 new formats, the problem was not fixed. I thought it might have just been my drive, but my friend got it and had the same problem."
3343,5,It worked when no-name drives and thumb drives failed.,"First, I tried cheaper no-name hard drives and thumb drives. They both failed as I tried copying 1/2 TB over to them. So I went with Seagate, a name brand, and it is working flawlessly."
3344,5,Worked to add storage to my xbox 360s,Bought to add storage to xbox360s. Works good
3345,1,Piece of CRAP!,"Bought this in April, by Jan it was dead. One it it just randomly decided to beep, beep and beep and refused to be recognized on my computer - tired all the troubleshooting I found online - cleaned the ports, tried a different cable, different computer etc and NOTHING! Just a random fun failed Sunday!!! Beyond livid as I lost tons of data"
3346,5,Works good,Works good & easy setup. Added plenty of space and now I can download a ton of games.
3347,1,Errased all my data,I purchased this to have external space because my computer is full.I am an accountant and after backing ALL of my data it was gone.I lost everything and I am not happy at all.It is also very slow and freezes my computer multiple times.I won't be using it. Trash
3348,3,Not compatible with PS5,"Storage is fine, very easy to install and use.. however when i paired it to my PS5 i quickly found out you can not save PS5 games or apps.. it only wotks for PS4"
3349,4,Great buy,Product came quick.It works well no complaints
3350,5,Small form factor with great capacity,I really like this drive. It has a lot of capacity to store large files. Very fast USB 3 connectivity for fast file transfers. I recommend this drive to all.
3351,5,I love the size of the hard drive and the space capacity.,It’s fits perfectly in my set up and don’t take up space .
3352,1,Don’t waste your time,"DO NOT BUY, constantly disconnecting right in the middle of use. I could be running it all day and it will disconnect randomly 3-5 times a day and the memory bank won’t even show up on my system. Don’t waste your time with this low grade external drive."
3353,2,Won't stay plugged in,"Okay my son has one, its great.My 12 year old daughter purchased one with her Christmas money and it won't stay plugged into her computer.I tried it in mine and it does the same thing.It just won't make a secure connection.The USB plug wobbles, which i'm sure means it will break soon.Ugh"
3354,5,Works as intended.,"Works fine with the ps4 and the ps5. I put the ps4 games on it and moved it to the ps5. Works fine,no issues.The cobalt said to plug it into one of the back ports, not the front."
3355,1,Very dissapointed by support and how warranty is being handled,"I bought the HDD in 2021 and it went down with a lot of bad sectors in a few months. It made the HDD unusable.I sent it back to Seagate and just my replacement which seems to be manufactured in 2020, but my biggest concern is about write speed. My original drive had about 150 Mb/S speed and the drive I've got doesn't go above 30 Mb/sIt's absolutely not a replacement with similar characteristics (in terms of speed).I wouldn't buy again Seagate products."
3356,1,"<1 MB/s write rate on brand new 2.5"" 5TB HDD.","Seagate Portable 5TB (STGX5000400) drive has horrible performance. Did some FIO tests on a brand new drive and the write rates were less than 1MB/s- even ancient rust from 2011 under the same environment and test outperformed by 10x.Do not buy this drive if you expect any ""performance"" from it.Test ran: fio --name=random-write --ioengine=posixaio --rw=randwrite --bs=4k --numjobs=1 --size=4g --iodepth=1 --runtime=60 --time_based --end_fsync=1 --filename=/dev/sdaResults: WRITE: bw=630KiB/s (645kB/s), 630KiB/s-630KiB/s (645kB/s-645kB/s), io=1263MiB (1324MB), run=2051178-2051178msec"
3357,4,An answer to prayers with very little problems,"Great for backups.I was having issues with recovery from secondary drives. The drive would continuously disconnect with error messages. Online sources sited everything from viruses to full failure. I had this drive passing through a usb splitter, which was fine for backups but not for file transfer. I plugged it directly to the computer and it works better than ever."
3358,1,Make sure the device isn’t defective before putting things on it.,"Wait before putting anything important on this. The day after I got this Hard Drive, it stopped working with all of my games on it. I tried every troubleshooting tip and completely reset my Xbox trying to fix it. I found out that you can plug the Hard Drive into your PC to see if the device has an error, and it was the device itself. Luckily, Amazon Support was awesome and is sending me a new device. I’ll hopefully be updating this review after receiving the new drive. It just sucks to have lost those games and went through so much effort due to a defected device."
3359,5,Reliability and speed,Compact high capacity storage with excellent fast transfer speed
3360,5,Great gift,Really extended my grandson’s game capacity!
3361,5,I bought this for the Xbox series X,If you bought this for the Xbox series X you need to reformat it on your Xbox otherwise it will just act as a media player
3362,5,Very Pleased with my Purchase,I purchased the Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive to act as my back up drive on my Mac.It works just fine.I've very pleased with my purchase.
3363,5,Works well,"Smaller than I expected so it doesn't take up much space at all, works well to allow extra game storage for the XBox Series S."
3364,5,Great for a ps4,I will always buy Seagate. I bought this for my boyfriend's ps4 and it is perfect! It quadrupled his ps4 storage and it easily plays games directly off of the external storage.
3365,5,Quality product,Quick delivery. Good product excellent prices
3366,1,Crashed In 3 Months with Film Footage,"This hard drive crashed with a lot of footage from a documentary we shot in just 3 months! Waiting to see if they'll replace the faulty drive. Warranty was purchased with drive, so we'll see..."
3367,5,THIS PRODUCT ISMORE CHEAPER THAN WD PRODUCT.,SEAGATE'S PRODUCT QUALITY IS SAME AS WD EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE.THIS PRODUCT ISMORE CHEAPER THAN WD PRODUCT.
3368,1,cannot use it,"Can't install the software and drag and drop. The 'To get set up, connect the portable hard drive to a computer for automatic recognition no software required' is a lie..."
3369,5,Amazing,It’s very useful it’s a good investment buy it it’s really good I have so much extra space on my Ps4 now I don’t have to delete games anymore
3370,5,Solid,"Been using this for the better part of a year and it's as reliable as the first day I got it. The speeds are decent for an HDD, it's super small. Wish the cable was C-to-C USB but oh well."
3371,5,Easy to store.,Love that this will hold a ton of photos & videos and doesn't take up much storage space.
3372,4,Works Like a Charm,"Hooked up easily and looks nice. The worst thing I can say about it is that it takes a bit longer for my PS4 to boot up. Stands to reason as it has more memory to read now. Well worth the money and the time spent transferring from smaller external. If you are getting an external for a PS4, save yourself some headache and get a 8T to bein with."
3373,4,Good value for price,Plastic case feels a bit fragile but otherwise it's a reliable external drive.
3374,2,Not able to use it,Not compatible with my device
3375,5,Just what I was looking for!,I'm a photographer and needed a place to combine all my many HD's in an effort to reduce time searching for work.This drive helps solve that problem for me.I'm on a Mac and it worked perfectly right out of the box and is fast.I am very happy I purchased it and am considering purchasing a second to work as a copy (backup) of this drive.
3376,5,Perfect for my son's Xbox,Bought this for my son's Xbox for extra game storage and it is perfect! He has multiple games and there is still plenty of space for more. This drive itself is about the size of your hand and is easily connected to his console. Great price too.
3377,5,Works just like it should.,Got here fast and works great.
3378,5,Good so far!,I bought it because my ps4 storage is completely full with only a few games. Started downloading games on this and it's doing the job! I even was able to get new games. Just hoping I don't fill it up before the new dying light 2 comes out (insert nervous laugh)
3379,5,The Backup I Needed,"This is a great solution for my needs, with plenty of storage space to backup my main hard drive for years to come. Very small size and very easy to set up. No tech support needed!:)"
3380,5,Great drive for the money,"I find this drive, at least after a few months, to be reliable and a great addition to my Raspberry Pi.I have the same one in 2TBs, and with my Mac mini it sometimes will freeze when clicking the icon, but I don't know if that's a computer/hub/hardware issue or not.But this 1 TB has been perfect so far.Seems pretty good."
3381,2,Don't always depend on it,"I have bought Seagate products for over five years now. I am currently on my fourth Seagate drive, after the previous three had eventually hiccuped and stopped working reliably.This particular drive was my third Seagate drive. As a video gamer I found Seagate very unreliable for everyday use, especially when using them for PlayStation or Xbox. I exclusively use these drives now for the PC, so I can keep photos, documents and other data stored in the external drives.This Seagate product has very low transfer speeds. On countless occasions when I moved a large amount of data (50+ GBs) I would keep getting an error, and the thing would just stop transferring altogether.The biggest problem I have is how finicky and fragile the drives are. I used to always keep my portable drives connected to the computer via USB, but I have found that they decide to stop working a few months to a year after I first plugged them in. I now unplug the drives whenever I'm away or if I shut down my computer. Doesn't mean they're all too reliable.The oldest Seagate I have is completely broken and unusable, the second oldest is barely functional. I thought with this product Seagate would of improved the reliability and durability of the portable drives, but apparently I was wrong.These drives are okay for one time use if you're just using them for archival purposes. But if you transfer, move and delete files often like I do, this is not the best product. After doing a little research I discovered that doing these actions will greatly speed up the process in which your drive will eventually become a brick.Buyer beware. If you want a strong and sturdy drive, look elsewhere."
3382,5,"Good drive, works with a PI",using it for storage on my raspberry pi4 that is running Plex. working great
3383,5,Vale la inversión,Ya llevo unos dos meses usándolo y vale la inversión por completo! Incluso transferi las fotos de mi celular y sin problema. Muy practico y seguro para todos tus documentos 👌🏽
3384,5,works as expected,"used for playstation 4, plugged it in and the system recognized it right away."
3385,5,Excelente entrega y muy bonito,"Es de 5 tb,tiene mucha memoria"
3386,5,Works as intended,Very helpful for storage
3387,5,This is a great hard drive to have!,I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good portable hard drive. It is very compact and easy to carry back and forth from anywhere you need to go. I have used this hard drive for more than two years now and I have never once had a problem with it. It is very durable and can be used for anything!
3388,5,Very good HDD for backups,I use several of these drives for backups and they work great.
3389,5,Really good but is really only 1.8 tb,Good but really on 1.8 tb
3390,5,Works!,Works as intended.
3391,3,"Does not work for ps5. Other than that, great product.",Functions great just not compatible with Ps5. Great products though.
3392,5,"Don't let it get banged, you lose !!!","1.81 TB actual, overall quality is excellent, just needs to be guarded against accidental hard knocks or drops, you lose everything."
3393,5,Plug & play used with OTA Tablo dvr. Excellent.,Simple to use.Small foot print. And it works flawlessly
3394,5,So far so good,Plugged it in...worked right off...backed up half terabyte no problem.Very happy thus far
3395,5,Plenty of back up space nice to have it all in one place,"I loved everything about this, I gave 5 stars for tech support but I didn’t even need to use it"
3396,5,It worked well.,It's small and compact. Easily fits in my pocket. Great product.
3397,1,didnt last long,as far as external hdds go i find all the ones ive had that plug into the wall die but all the ones i have that are strictly usb last forever
3398,5,Su valiosa utilidad 👍🏻,Todo súper bien
3399,1,Piece of Digital JUNK,"It lasted one year and twenty five days before it stopped working. Of course, I'm just out of warranty. Seagate durability is a joke."
3400,5,Used it right away and half I did. Computer crashed and everything was backed up. Great value.,Loved it’s ease of use and reliability.
3401,5,Great for gaming!,Great product!
3402,5,Data to GO.,"I haven't had any problems with this product, so I couldn't award any STARS in this rating for ""support"". Like I said, I haven't had any problems with this external drive. It was plug & play, right out of the box, with the cable provided. If I had the ability to make one change to this device, it would be with the cable end that plugs into the drive. I would have used a USB C connector, so it wouldn't matter which way you grabbed the device end of the cable (no flipping) to plug it in. USB C connectors should be universal on ALL external drives, by ALL manufacturers. This is a good product, overall. Very affordable."
3403,1,I am just trying to get ahold of a company rep,I bought this and just discovered it does not have an adapter for my electric socket!!!!!How am I supposed to use it?
3404,5,Excelente,Excelente
3405,1,Broke in less than 2 years,"This hard drive performed the same as any other one would. However, it was used sparingly, maybe about 200 hours, before it suddenly and totally failed. My recommendation: spend the money to buy a solid state device."
3406,5,Easy Plug & Play,"Honestly I bought mine used. It’s worth the money either way, brand new or not. Shipped fast. Got it with a USB cable and I plugged it right in and doubled my storage immediately… I formatted it to my Xbox series s and I got to downloading a good amount of games. I bought this one for games that are non optimized vs the Storage Expansion I bought that too. I currently have about 50 or more games non X/S multiple call of duty’s, multiple assassins creeds, other games as well. They all run good, the download speed was nice, I can’t complain about any of it because it does the job I needed it to do. Other than that I was glad I made a purchase with a reputable company like Seagate, easy to take on the go if you have to and I don’t really need another one because I still storage for more games. (Not counting or including the storage from console or storage expansion card)"
3407,5,Excellent,"Receive this as a gift for Christmas and it works great! Capacity is as advertised, file transfers were pretty quick from my old windows pc. Easy to use and portable.Glad to have a backup for all mine photos, videos and documents."
3408,1,"Avoid like the Plague, Drive Crashed in less then Two Months and lost 4TB of data","High recommendyou don’t buy this drive, the drive failed after two months and I lost everything. Customer support is non existent and the data recovery system is faulty. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!"
3409,5,"Great Drive, Made Well, Works Good For Photo & Video - Bill Mahon Photo & Video","I have used these and other Seagate External Hard Drives for many years now for my photo and video business. The early years of Seagate were a disaster but I have not had any problems for many years now. I always buy these when they go on sale. I use these for Mac and PC, you just have to format them on an iMac/Mac in ExFat if you want them to work on both Mac and PC and they work well. You can format them them in any format that works for any computer also. Bill Mahon Photo & Video"
3410,5,Excellent External HD,This works great with my Dish Wally to store recordings.Highly recommend!
3411,5,Great for DVR,"This very compact and large capacity hard drive works great with my new DVR which makes cutting the cable cord easier - able to record broadcast news, etc."
3412,5,Great product.Great for the playstation.,Great product.Great storage for the playstation
3413,5,Works as intended,Incredibly easy to use and I’ve had 0 issues with game storage. Hooked it up to my Xbox and has saved me a lot of time with uninstalling and reinstalling games.
3414,2,Speed not great,"This is basically the exact same as the one I purchased several years ago.I would have expected an improvement in performance.If performance is an issue for you as well, please make sure to purchase a model that uses an SSD or M.2 drive in the encloser and not mechanical."
3415,2,Sloooooooow,This is unusable for a photographer who needs to back up large quantities of photos. The write times are insanely slow. Highly regret the purchase. It's probably fine for anyone just backing up text documents.
3416,1,Legit read only and cant use on mac without signing up for subscription.,Pretty disappointed that this harddrive is read only and cant be changed without signing up for a subscription with seagate.
3417,1,Nor user friendly.,Worked with 3 techs and it still didn't work. Not user friendly for Mac users.
3418,1,To slow,Not good because I can’t play off the drive
3419,1,Too complicated,The media could not be loaded. I don’t understand how this thing works. You have to download some app and then it tells you that it doesn’t work for Mac. I will return this thing. A waste of time and money.
3420,5,It's Very Good,I bought one of these years ago and filled it up. So I liked it well enough to buy it again. Perfect for traveling and clearing the hard drive on my skimpy laptop Apple hard drive.
3421,5,Great external harddrive!,This hard drive functions as expected!
3422,4,Drive works great,Good buy
3423,5,Works well with xbox,Works wonderful on my XBOX one I have 20 BIG games installed and have only used 1TB of the 2TB. I LOVE IT.
3424,5,Handy and easy to use,
3425,4,Reliable,The many Seagate external hard disks I own are and have been very reliable with no disk errors.
3426,5,Great product,"Large capacity, easy to set up and very small."
3427,1,Complete garbage!! Don't buy,"Disk doesn't show up now my computer, so, obviously, I can't open it. Everything saved on it is lost. I went online and, apparently, this is a long-standing problem with Seagate. They offer many solutions, but none work. SAVE YOUR MONEY and your work!!"
3428,1,DO NOT PURCHASE. Crashed after 24 hours & data cannot be recovered.,"This purchase made me lose tons of data. I was transferring files & the harddrive crashed on me out of nowhere… it was sitting flat on the desk right next to my laptop (cord is short). Tech support what’s to say “you damaged it or dropped it to cause this to happen” and that’s definitely not the case. They were unable to recover my data. I’m beyond frustrated and will never purchase a Seagate product again. The first external harddrive I ever used & it screwed me. DO NOT PURCHASE & TAKE THE CHANCE!Also, like others have stated, the speed was very slow while I was using it.Seagate offered to replace the product but I honestly cannot trust that the same thing won’t happen again. It already burned me once."
3429,1,Weird defrag performance makes drive marginally useful,"I can't get this drive to defragment as expected; I've tried both Ultimate Defrag (application locks up) and Smart Defrag (application runs very, very slowly) on two Windows 10 Professional boxes.On my other drives (I have about 15 TB over six drives), a 1 GB file in a couple of fragments would complete in a minute or two.With this drive and Smart Defrag, it's taken more than 20 minutes.The drive has not shown as busy, nor has CPU utilization risen.This drive came formatted as exFAT and that may be the problem--some utilities may not have (good) support for that format.More to come."
3430,5,Great for PS4/PS5,"With games becoming larger with each year, more space is becoming a necessity rather than an amenity. The PS4/PS5 only comes with about 1tb of storage, which is fine if you only play a couple of games, but if you want to play a bunch of games, you're going to need to expand your storage.This external hard drive works perfectly as a PS4/PS5 storage expansion unit. I purchased the 2 tb version, which should be around $70: an amazing price. I've been able to install all the games that I wanted to play and still have enough storage available for anything else.Great external hard drive"
3431,1,Is it compatible with your computer,It was not compatible with my computer
3432,5,quality,states 18 TB but is really 16. Amazon compensated
3433,5,Gift for my son,My son needed this product for school and other necessities. He says it's perfect for his needs and is happy with it's performance.
3434,5,Great product,Great product
3435,5,Great drive,"Set up super easy, backed up my files in a snap.All I could hope for."
3436,5,Lots of Storage Space,I have a 1TB version of this that has been working great for a few years.So far this 5TB version has had no problems.
3437,3,Its not 8TB,This is only 7.27 TB not 8TB as advertised. Disappointed
3438,2,So slow! I will gray before this file gets copied.,565 GB will take more than a day to copy?? Seriously? I just got this yesterday and am only at 21%. This drive should come with a bottle of hair dye because I will gray from frustration…or I will get gray by the time I fill up the drive.It’s only a 565 GB copy… how long will it take to fill up a 10 TB drive? My life span? I should had bought this when I was a toddler…at this speed…just to have enough time to fill up the drive.The second photo shows the 1.15TB I’m backing up from a 2tb drive to the Seagate 10TB. It shows it’s copying 2.38TB instead of 1.15TB. It’s not a mistake because my 2tb drive can’t hold 2.38TB. This drive is filling it up with something. I’ll find out in 14 hours…I didn’t give it the stars it’s deserved— 1 star —because it’s not a DOA brick. The day is still young.BTW it’s 9.09TB not 10TB new from the box. Plus it makes a drum sound. At 6am I checked up on the progress and thought my neighbors were playing their drums. It’s not loud but it can’t be good.Pro: the packaging was good in protecting it during shipping. The cable looks sturdy. It comes with a website link for the instructions (no paper manual). I saved a tree.
3439,1,Won't work,Won't play newer games and won't move them to external drive without saying it has to be in the internal.
3440,4,Fantastic external Hard-drive,"Not a single problem with this thing, quickly moved all my PS4 files and back off to the races"
3441,5,Easy top setup,Super easy to install/set up. Plug and Play
3442,1,Will break after a few months,Works great until it doesn't. This is my second Seagate external drive and the second time that after about 3 months it suddenly stops working.I'll switch to a more reliable brand from now on.
3443,3,Seems to work.,I like how light and small it is. I hope it allows easy retrieval.
3444,3,So slow,"I got this because it was cheap and well rated. I hope it lasts for the archive purpose that I got it for because it sure is slow. Getting about 12 MB/s. At this rate, the backup should be done when i wake up in a few hours. Don’t get this if time is valuable to you."
3445,5,Very reliable external hard drive,I've been purchasing Seagate external hard drives for a while. They are very reliable with a lot of storage space.
3446,5,Nice and easy,Easy to use. Plug-in and go. Nice compact size.
3447,5,gaming,grandson seems happy with this product
3448,4,I live by Seagate products,"For years I have only use Seagate Drives most important, they last. I now have 10 active all sizes."
3449,5,Great gift,Came quick! Great price was a gift for my father in law to store family photos and back up his labtop!
3450,5,Great,Works good
3451,3,Torn on this.,I have several of these Seagate 4tb drives that all came sealed in a Seagate box. This one came shipped in a brown box . So far it did register with Seagate online . I am writing data to it now so only time will tell . The drive it self is different than all other drives of the same model number so I struggle with it's legitimacy .
3452,4,What was needed,Used as a backup drive. Storage capacity is good!
3453,5,Worth It,It is easy to set up and connect with your device and allows for a ton of games to download and still have space for more. Really worth it
3454,5,The extra storage is fantastic,"This product is lightweight but holds a lot, no more need to worry about space any more."
3455,1,Used and broken,Arrived w/a name already programmed on the drive and could not save to the drive. Dud. Returned.
3456,5,Exactly what I wanted,Delivery was fast. Price was right. Product quality appears to be exactly what I desired.
3457,1,Corrupted Mac softare so the drive is useless - 2 times!!!,This is the second drive I have received with corrupted software on it.
3458,5,Just buy it,"It's 5TB of portable data. Transfer speeds are over USB 3.0, so relatively fast depending on your device. I'd reccomend to anyone who needs this much portable data storage."
3459,1,Highly unreliable!,I bought Seagate brand 2 yrs ago and stopped working. Now bought another one and only worked for 2 hrs!
3460,1,Doesn’t work with new Xbox series s DONT BUY!!!,I formatted it to my Xbox series s and I tried to download games and it said that I need a faster extension drive to play the game. Very un impressed would not buy again.
3461,5,Works Great,Plug and go.!Only took a couple on minutes to install
3462,4,Love,I got mine preused and I love it
3463,2,Not recomended,"The hard disk is too slow, has many errors during data transfer, does not give confidence to store important data."
3464,4,Larger than expected,"I have two much smaller drives that are a bit bigger than a deck of cards.This unit is nearly 8-10x bigger despite the extra capacity.Not as portable in that sense.Also requires and comes with a larger power cable to plug into the wall, where my smaller drives are USB powered.I wasn't expecting that.Otherwise, was still a well made product and has tons of capacity for storage."
3465,5,Good purchase.,Product received on time and was as described.
3466,5,Great Value!,Easy to use and plenty of storage for the money.
3467,1,Not working.,the product is not working at all it doesn't turn on.
3468,1,Stopped working after 8 months,"This HDD was working great but after 8 months it no longer is connecting to my laptop. I tried it on a different device also and it is not responding. I never dropped the drive and safely ejected every time I use it. Please save yourself the stress and buy a Solid State Drive instead, that is what I should have done."
3469,5,Not overly gigantic,It's got a nice size and look to it. Doesn't take any space on my desk and was an easy setup. I've already got it working and babbling up a ton of stuff before I put in the new internal HDD and a fresh install of windows.
3470,5,External for my TV shows,When my hard drive died on my TV recording device I bought this External to replace it.It would have cost me $400 to replace the box on my Channel Master - so this was the very next thing I thought I'd try.Works great.
3471,3,It isn't as easy as I thought it would be.,"Storage capacity is great. I'm still trying to get it setup to backup what I want. It appeared that mirror was going to work, but that puts all my files together. It doesn't separate pictures from documents."
3472,5,Great Battery,"This battery charges my phone easily. It's a bit heavy, but it get the job done easily."
3473,5,I have always had great experience with seagate,had to tweak some settings out of the box but after that it had great transfer speed. seems the out of the box its set to 2.0 speed for safe removal but if you can remember to use the safely remove option then you get 3.0
3474,4,that’ll do donkey,that’ll do
3475,1,P.O.S. Do nit buy.,It said plug and play. But as soon as a pluged in it and tried to use it it said the device does not exist on my computer. I am returning it.
3476,4,Works,So Far it has been working
3477,5,Works great to add storage to my sons PS4,Works great. Needed it for more storage on PS4 for my son. Easy set up too.
3478,5,Super easy set up for PS4,Just plugged it into my PS4 and the system recognized it and prompted me how to format the drive and assign it to default for future application downloads. Within 5 minutes I was downloading my game library to it. If you’ve been searching for an affordable external drive that’s easy to use this is it.
3479,5,Love it!,🥰
3480,5,It's a great External HDD.,It was perfect for my PS4. 2 TB storage was more than enough for all my games. It really came in handy so I didn't have to keep deleting games cus my PS4 was out of storage... Still works with my ps5 but I only store my PS4 games on it. Even after getting my new console it's still useful to me!
3481,5,Great Product!,Great Product!
3482,5,Love it,Upgraded my DVR and needed to save recordings and timer and this thing was amazing and so much storage.
3483,1,Didnt connect to my ps4,"It didn’t connect to my ps4, it’s possible it couldve been defective, at least it’s returnable and got a refund"
3484,5,Great Storage,"I used this device for my Xbox because 1 terabyte is not enough these days especially for someone who likes playing multiple games that are also Triple A games with friends. This device was able to have my Xbox storage able to hold GTA V, Apex Legends, Far Cry 6, Rainbow Six Siege, and Multiple Call Of Duty game, all while still having 1.8 terabytes left which made me feel like I wasn't wasting money and time on games I had to delete and redownload games to make more space for more games. All in all 10/10 did it's job and a real time saver and great investment."
3485,5,ps4..... no problem,Bought this for external storage for the ps4........ hooked up and formatted no sweat!!!!!! Works Great!!!!!
3486,5,I use it to back-up my MacBook Pro M1 laptop,"With this I don't need a ""cloud"". I take about 12,000 pictures a year. 24,000 since each picture is a JPEG and a RAW. I sort the so-so's out and work with the rest. Very fast and efficient. Since it is the back-up drive it is only for this computer. I am thinking of getting another to be used as storage away from the computer. Who knows when big tech will hold your ""cloud records hostage?"
3487,5,Great Storage Device,Got this for my nephew to transport video work between home and school. He loves it
3488,5,Great gift idea,As good as advertised
3489,1,Died after 6 months with low to medium usage - Xbox external drive,Drive worked great for 6 months. Purchased June 2021 and died 12/30/2021. Was used frequently for first few monthsand used sparingly the last 2 months (less than 5 hours per week). Xbox won’t recognize the drive anymore. Switched cables to no avail. Tried other computers and they don’t recognize it either (including using disk part and disk management). Shucked it to try to connect directly to computer with the same results. The drive spins up and led lights up but can’t be recognized. Has never been dropped or mishandled ( was plugged into rear port on xbox and remained on a shelf behind tv/Xbox). Would recommend a drive other than this as a gaming console external hard drive.
3490,1,Not useable,"Tried for hours the drive takes hours to transfer just about anything, if you wanna use this for games forget it it freezes even the most simplest of games, even disconnecting the whole hard drive sometimes."
3491,5,Perfect,Perfect for extra storage.
3492,4,"Windows 10 requires it be ""Programmed"".Bah Humbug!","I purchased this Seagate hard drive because I have had one for many years and it holds a lot and downloads with no problem.Now Windows 10 (Ugh!) requires my new one be""programmed"" before I can use it and I have no idea how to do that.Although this drive was inexpensive, it is going to cost me big bucks to go to a computer specialist to get it ""programmed""."
3493,5,Ur guys are awesome,No problem everything is perfect
3494,5,Works with ps4/ ps5,Got it for the PlayStation 5 works perfect I recommend it
3495,5,Storage is amazing,To back up my computer. And for my photos somewhere to be stored.
3496,5,It’s good,Hello
3497,5,great product,A great portable or external storage device for either a system backups or large storage requirements.
3498,5,Works great,Perfect for my Xbox all my games loaded easily
3499,5,Perfect for PS4 external storage,Super compact and easy to set up!
3500,5,Quick and easy plug and use.,Slim design and started working right away without any installation.
3501,5,Very slim!,Love it used to carry a old brick now lighter than ever and easy to store love this HDD
3502,5,What can I say!,Worked like a charm right out of the box! Hooked it up to ps4…. Allowed it to reformat and bam were in business! Lol
3503,4,I trust my footage a Seagate,I’ve had 10 different seagates and I never had one crap out on me
3504,5,Muy bueno,Good
3505,5,Does the job,Works great
3506,4,Works good,It works perfectly but it said I was getting 2 tb and I only got 1.84 not a big deal tho
3507,1,Not in its original box. That’s a no for me. I’m sending it back,
3508,5,Best for the Price,Its Good... am able to save all my data here.
3509,5,Great hdd,Great hdd
3510,1,Only compatible with pc,"I got this because it said it was compatible with ps4, it is not. Do not waste your money. Its great for the computer however"
3511,5,Exactly what I needed,Great product
3512,5,Awesome for the price,Can’t beat it for the price. Have it formatted for MAC/WIN and transfers data wuickly
3513,5,Great Compact 2TB external hard drive,"compact, portable and easy to format to MAC or PC"
3514,1,Crashed,"Product worked for a few months, but crashed and now the device is not being recognized - meaning, the D drive is not being recognized .. lost important files, etc.."
3515,5,External hard drive.,"It was Given to a family member as a charismas present. It was built very sturdy. The storage capacity is great, the cost was good. It was shipped and received earlier than advertised.The receiver of the gift was very pleased."
3516,5,Great,Works as intended!
3517,5,Cheap and great external hard drive,It works great on my ps4 finally have space for all my games
3518,5,Don't be scared! (Mac User),So the reviews had me worried. But this guy is plug and play. I did register my device on the Seagate website. I've been dropping files on this guy since Day one and it's handled it like a champ. I have a Mac desktop and I've already used a quarter of the space. I like that I don't need a password to use it. Literally I click the icon and go right into the folder I need to grab project video. I'm in love. Highly recommend and would buy again in a heartbeat. Bye bye WD PASSPORT!!
3519,4,It says 2TB however I plugged it in and it’s now 1.8TB,This would have been a great product if it had the actual 2TB on it that I bought for a reason. Will be returning.
3520,5,"Just what I ordered,but, always order bigger!",Is good
3521,1,Problems from the start,"I bought this because I have another Seagate drive that's older and works well. This one was supposed to solve my memory problems for some time, as it is a 4TB drive. I was using it just to transfer files for easy retrieval. I was certain that I would not have any problems, since I had success with earlier Seagate drives. But I immediately had a problem with formatting. I kept having to verify. I managed to make one backup of some files. Then the disk wouldn't load and I had error messages. I used disk repair. I was able to make a few more backups during the first month I owned it. I think ,in total, I used it three times, and each time I had to use disk repair. Now it will not allow me to write any more data. The data stored seems to be intact, but I only have about 300 GB, which is less than half a TB. So nearly the entire 4 TB are not useful to me. As for what was backed up, I have to wait a considerable time for it to load, and then I always get an error message. I am very happy with my older Seagates. Now this is at least two of the newer ones that is bad. What happened? This is so discouraging, I think I will steer clear of Seagate from now on."
3522,5,Perfect,Just what I needed
3523,1,BREAKS YOUR SYSTEM,"Item absolutely just broke my husbands Xbox. His Xbox won’t even turn on anymore, was in perfect condition before plugging this device in. Not only was this a waste of money I’m now out a Xbox. Absolutely rediculous that this happened. If you value the technology you own, do NOT buy this item and save yourself around 400$ because you’ll have to replace the whole gaming system! Piece of crap hard drive !"
3524,5,works for an xbox series s,works great
3525,1,Does not work on the PS4,"I got this specifically for my PS4 because the word “PlayStation” is in the title. But this did not work on my PS4 at all. Unlike when I originally installed my first external hard drive, this one prompted the PS4 to just outright say “the storage device is not compatible”. Maybe take “PlayStation” out of your product’s title if it isn’t compatible with PlayStations, because now I’ve wasted my time and my money."
3526,4,For Mac users-you must convert the file type,"Extra steps for Mac users however, the website does a great job walking you through how to convert the file types."
3527,5,Easy to setup and use,Glad I purchased this. Helps me save things were taking up too much space in my comp.
3528,5,quality product,quality product
3529,1,Two Didn’t Work,I tried twice with this. Both came with broken software for Mac.Both were returned.I really wanted this to work.
3530,5,Great,Great
3531,1,Trash,This is my second one after my first one stopped working for my ps4 after 2 weeks so I sent it back and got a new one didn't even last me 1 week and it doest work again.
3532,4,Speeds,Has amazing storage but a lot of games I have to move on to internal storage because of the slower speeds.
3533,5,Good Value,"Even though it's slower writing than some others, it's good enough."
3534,1,DISPOSABLE - DO NOT TRUST SEAGATE. NOT ONCE BUT TWICE LOST 8TB IN 5 YEARS!!!,In 5 years I LOST 8 TB's of my files. This is a yearly back up done once every year so drive is not even used more than 5 days in total. If you have important stuff DO NOT TRUST these clowns. Tech support in one hour no solution but BS and HS!!! They are asking if I had a back up - FOOLS THIS WAS MY BACK UP!!!
3535,5,Came in perfect condition used it on my ps4,Comes in a box and inside it are the items it came with instructions and it was a quick process.
3536,1,Only 2 months and already throwing bad blocks,I've only had the hard drive for 2 months and it's already throwing hundreds of disk errors of bad blocks.Pretty worthless.
3537,5,Love it!,"With a sleek yet compact design, this is perfect extension for my PS5. It’s nice enough to keep displayed next to the monster that is a PS5. It’s got plenty of space and I have 0 complaints!"
3538,1,DOES NOT WORK WITH PS5,"I was looking for extra storage for my ps5 and this was one of the top results. However, it is not compatible with it in the slightest. The product should not be recommend under that search then if it’s not compatible. This is stupid."
3539,5,Excelente disco duro,Buen material y rapidez
3540,5,Fast and easy,"A lot cheaper than “Xbox” brand. quick, easy & efficient. Just plug in USB & download files.. Using for series s Xbox."
3541,5,Perfect for series S Xbox,Got my kids the series S xbox and it’s working perfectly good for them. They are happy to not have to delete and reload games and I got a special price for 30$ for 2TB. Can’t complain at all!
3542,5,Good for what it is,"Firstly, to address all the people saying that this drive is slow, yes, it is slow because it is not a solid state drive, but a hard disk drive. SSD's typically have way faster writing speeds and lifespans, but that's not really what people are looking for when buying HDD's since these are meant more for storage of media that you won't need on the fly. For example, I use it for storing things like old pictures, old recordings, and things that I generally won't be needing handy but still would rather keep. The writing speed, while a bit slow, (around 115 mbps average) is still bearable, and I'm overall happy with my purchase."
3543,5,Purposeful,Compact
3544,5,Great expansion.,"Works on both PS4 AND PS5. I formatted on my PS4 and added to my PS5. Works great. People said it couldn't be formatted on PS5 but, if you have both consoles, it's very easy."
3545,5,Was a gift,Asked my grand son how he liked it and how it worked. He loved it and it gave him so much more storage he could buy a lot more games. And if he’s happy I’m happy
3546,5,"Not in use yet, but eventually will be.","I purchased 3 of these drives to replace 4 2TB flash drives that gave me error messages after so much data was stored on them I had purchased a couple of other Seagate portable HD's from Best Buy, a while back. These new 2TB Portables are for future use. I have had good luck storing data on these in the past, but I know after a certain amount of use, any external drive will go bad. So, I backup my same data, I never want to lose on a new drive. These drives will provide that function. The price was right, So, I bought them. Thank You!!"
3547,5,I highly recommend it! Especially for Xbox Series X|S!,"Transfers games at about 1TB of moving speed BUT the games that you transfer must NOT be Xbox X|S enhanced, because it would require faster storage, HERES THE TICKER, instead of deleting the games, just transfer them"
3548,5,Perfect for audio recording with Cakewalk by Bandlab,"I'd already had one of these drives for backup routines for my business computer. It never stalled, crashed, became unresponsive or logged errors to my backup software. So, when it came time to replace an ancient (yet dependable) Seagate drive that I had used for years for audio production, I wondered if this little portable 2TB drive could handle audio recording/editing in Sonar, Audio Cleaning Lab and Cakewalk by Bandlab. I was concerned that it didn't have its own power source. Nevertheless, so far, so good! It beats buying more than what is required (e.g. a solid state drive.) This is a perfect, little drive for my applications."
3549,1,Completely Garbage,"Bought 2 of these, one for my computer and one for my Xbox. Both of them corrupted the machines the second I plugged them in. My computer started giving me Bios system errors everytime I restarted the computer. The Xbox One wouldn’t let my access settings, start games, or pretty much do anything. I unplugged both of them and the computers went back to normal. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!"
3550,1,Bricked after 2 weeks,Worked fine at first. I used it to store games for Xbox x. Just randomly stopped working one day. Unreadable on pc and Xbox. Bricked. Very disappointing. Tried to return it they wouldn't without the box. Waste money bad brand
3551,1,The least reliable drive of the hdd brands sadly.,"Out of the hdd brands I've used from Lexar, Samsung, Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital, I have had both my 2tb and now 5tb drives run into issues.The 2 tb drive had constant boot errors when I would use it on my laptop, but it was my first large hdd and would work besides that. I had it for about a year before I started having issues with it, which prompted me to get this new drive, chucking it up to bad luck.The new 5tb hdd drive, which I purchased in conjunction with a seagate drive for backups either way I got in April. Now in December, 8 months later, the drive has stopped working. No signs. I literally used it last night, powered down my machine, powered it back up in the morning and the drive is unreadable.I can't tell what I'm doing wrong, because it's just these drives. I've had the Toshiba for 7 years. I tried ignore my bias and trust the good reviews and numbers, but this is frustrating."
3552,5,Great product,"It did exactly what I wanted, and so far zero complaints"
3553,5,Works great,Bought for my sons ps4 works great
3554,5,Easy,So easy to use and get started with. Recommend formatting the drive to exfat before backing things up so that way you can use it on windows or Mac with no issues
3555,1,"Was great, until it wasn't.","Great price and worked well for approximately 1.5 yrs, then it just stopped working.This HDD sat on my desk the entire time in a climate controlled environment. I tried a different cord, however it just doesn't work. Looks like my experience is atypical."
3556,5,Works great!,We have an Xbox one and were at the point of having to unload games just to put a new one on. This was easy to set up and works great.Would definitely recommend it!
3557,4,Performance as expected (5 TB),"I'm 24 hours into a fairly large backup of photos (over 124,000 files) using Seagate's Toolkit to Mirror these files from a desktop onto the Seagate Portable external drive.First, the 5 TB unit is compact and quiet.I'm used to using other Seagate external drives which are much larger and require a dedicated power source.I'm happy to report there have been no issues with the USB power feed.I read a number of reviews commenting on noise.The unit I received is whisper quiet.Twenty-four hours into the Mirror operation the unit is not building up any heat and is barely warm to the touch.Speed......for reference the Seagate Portable drive is connected to a quality desktop computer using a 3.0 USB connection.In 24 hours the Mirror program has copied 1.4 TB of files, so it’s not exactly a fast process.I suspect the process is slowed by the large number of files found in numerous file folders and subfolders.Once the Mirror process is initially completed, future mirroring to synch files between the Seagate external drive and desktop is very efficient and quick (I use Mirror on two other smaller Seagate drives).I have to admit that I am spoiled by the speed offered by other portable SSDs that I own, but for my purpose, this drive does it's job.....that is to store large quantities of files with a way to quickly synch files with my desktop PC on a regular basis.Bottom line, this small drive works fine as a way to backup my files."
3558,5,Seagate works well,"I picked up 2 of these, one for a MacBook Pro, one for a Dell tower; they work great as external backup drivers, fast quiet and reliable. Backups are just a fact of life these days and so easy to do.Get the size you need but get a Seagate, they work."
3559,5,Great for backing up your computer,Small and compact
3560,5,Nice to have extra storage & backup docs/info,"Customer of Seagate, and pleased with my external hard drive.I purchased this one as a gift."
3561,5,Great storage,"Easy Installation, 13 year old hooked up and got it going in no time. tones of storage space with 5 trig."
3562,1,Worst 16tb external storage,False information from Seagate when they give you 14.5tb instead of 16tb. For this charge for false storage. I would return this if anyone purchases this storage.
3563,5,I like this item,"Had a little trouble getting it to work the first time, but it seems to work well now."
3564,5,Great addition to RV,"Bought this to back up everything we had on phones, laptops and computers."
3565,5,Love it!,"I've only saved items to it and it is still not full. Great value for the money, quality product and recommended it to my business partner who bought one as well. Pretty cool!"
3566,5,Great,Worked great right out of the box. -Check out my book Time Unwanted. -
3567,4,Great hard drive,Just what I needed
3568,5,Awesome,Great value for the money.
3569,5,Good drive,Good drive
3570,5,Best on the market.,"For reliability, durabiilty and ease of use, nothing better."
3571,4,Only useful for external storage for PlayStation,"Was able to save applications on the storage but not saved data, capture gallery, or themes so it not best for transfer everything from one PlayStation to another but was great for extra storage."
3572,5,Bien,Bien
3573,1,PS4,I just got this device for Christmas… plugged it into my PS4 and instantly my PS4 said it was unsupported and couldn’t use it… these guys ruined my Christmas and will be hearing from me
3574,5,Excelente producto y rápido,"Muy rápido para el traspaso de información, buen diseño. Excelente inversión."
3575,4,How to format for PS4,"I bought this for for my son's ps4. When we first plugged it in the ps4 said it didn't recognize this device or something. The trick to formatting was once I went to device settings, usb devices, find the device....hit options, and format to exFat. The go back to usb devices and hit stop using it, unplug and plug it back in. Then it allowed me to set it up as external. Hope this helps, game on!"
3576,5,Great External HDD!!,"1 terabyte of data in a secure, private external HDD for $60, can't beat it. I use this new HDD as a back up to my original HDD. I don't trust the ""Cloud""."
3577,4,Backup storage for peace of mind,"My wife and I wanted something to safely backup both our laptop computers.This seems to fit the bill just fine, although the initial setup wasn't as intuitive as we were led to believe."
3578,5,Works Perfectly,"I got this for my xbox Series S, 2TB works perfectly, just plug it in and set it up in a few seconds. 100% Worth the money, very convenient to carry around as well, perfect size."
3579,5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"Awesome price for the amount of storage. I bought it to use it for my Xbox one, I plugged it in and it was simple to set up, I went from having 2 gigabytes, to now having 2 TB. I would highly recommend this product."
3580,4,Quck and fast loading,So far so good with all the videos and pictures I have stored on this device.
3581,1,Way too slow,Should have listened to other reviews here who said it was slow as hell.. my god were you right.... been trying to transfer 6gigs of data onto this thing for over twenty minutes now. Take their advice.. stay far far away if you have anything of substance to keep backed up.
3582,5,Just what I was looking for!,I bought this to have a place to install my games when I want to play them without taking up space on my internal hard drive. It has plenty of space and maybe even some to spare!
3583,5,Must have,The media could not be loaded. Works good
3584,5,X Box easy,Hooked right up to the XBOX and was recognized
3585,5,Amazing Storage for a great price!!,This little guys has amazing storage for a quarter of the price of an Xbox made 1TB SSD. You get about 940 GB and I have plenty of games installed on my Xbox Series S. That includes big games like the new Call Of Duty’s. I would definitely recommend this to anyone is short on storage.
3586,5,ADDED PS4 STORAGE!!!,Got tired of the 500G not being enough for gaming on my original ps4 so finally got this was worried at first but it shipped way faster than expected and works great thanks!
3587,3,Not a plug in fix,This is not just a simple plug in for Xbox 1 will lock up console
3588,2,Started Well... But Problems In 6 Months,"Windows10 Desktop machine. USB 3... Used as backup for files and has 4TB portability. Mounted and transferred files for several months using Windows backup. Then started to develop ""error"" msgs. Tried all WIN10 workarounds and command line efforts. Finally wouldn't recognize drive in File Explorer, Disk Management or Device Manager. Seagate wants shipping return paid and will send refirb drive back. I'll go with dependable WD MyBook 4TB desktop HDD. Keep it simple..."
3589,5,Great value,I bought this for expandable storage on my PlayStation.Does exactly what I want.
3590,5,Works for both pc and console,This did a great job expanding the space on my Xbox to 1.8TB
3591,5,works great,my son says it works good
3592,5,Needed it,I used it for my Xbox one and I buy it again if I have to
3593,2,Good for about a year I guess.,bought the 5 TB back in august of 2020 and used it on my Xbox series X. Worked great until yesterday it randomly started squeaking and decided to no longer read. Plugged it into my computer to troubleshoot it and everything said it was working fine. But have no way of accessing all my data I didn’t pay $100 to only last a little over a year and for all my data to be lost.
3594,4,Good for the price,"Stops being readable sometimes and I have to unplug the replug into my xbox series s to get it to recognize. To be fair it could be the xbox or seagate. Advertised as 2 terabytes, but comes as 1.8 terabytes. That's a 200 gigabytes difference, way more than any internal data use could explain. But for the price I would buy again. I just think they should call it what it is, a 1.8 terabyte external storage device."
3595,5,Excelente,"Me llego lo que esperaba, rápido y en óptimas condiciones."
3596,5,Extra Storage I Needed,"Exactly what I needed for my extra storage......abd it's portable....and attach to my other laptop.Thamks,Bill"
3597,1,Spoiled on PS5 in 5 months,"I used to play only on PS5, I am not a professional player, I played 15-20 hours a week at most, but it spoiled in 5 months. I do not recommend anyone to buy this."
3598,5,Works wonderful with the PS5,It works wonderful with the PS5 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
3599,5,Continuous back up- it's BRILLIANT!,I just bought this as an external drive as an added place for all my work but it comes with a super simple set up that means that all your work is continuously backed up!!Exactly what I was looking for because Google Drive Back up and Sync disappeared.
3600,1,Abruptly stopped working after a year,"I bought it December 7th, 2020. Just stopped working today, December 23 2021. Took it in to see what the problem was, turns out it just up and died, mechanical issues, I was advised to buy a new one. All it ever did was sit on my desk. Not saying this is guaranteed to happen to you, but I have a smaller external that's been chugging along happily since 2017, not a single problem. This was a weird experience."
3601,5,"Great product, price, and supplier!","Great product, price, and supplier!"
3602,5,Good. Fast delivery.,Good. Fast delivery.
3603,3,PS5 NO!,Doesn’t support ps5!!! When connected and formatted it only allows ps4 games to be transferred but none of my ps5 games
3604,1,Failed just after the one-year recovery window,I've had it for just over a year and it just suddenly failed. It's now a useless brick.
3605,5,Excelente disco.,Excelente producto. Muy estable.
3606,5,Great item,Works as advertised
3607,1,It didn’tcame in original box,It didn’tcame in original box! It looks like used! They send it twice that way so I had to return!
3608,5,Great storage device!,"Love the storage space but after having used it, I realize I should have reformatted it before adding things to it in order to accommodate for particular programs on my pc. Other than that, it's a tip top device, particularly for a gaming pc when you need space to store other programs and files."
3609,5,It's good for what I bought it for. Space,I liked it. It's a good product
3610,1,glitching and not trustworthy for my application. my older seagate is performing better,started glitching but I thought it was my setup. then had difficultly pulling up files. not reliable to me as I cannot trust it. owned almost exactly a year. My older Seagate is a workhorse and is still going strong. frustrating! Have to buy another one.
3611,5,It works,It works
3612,5,Sony PlayStation PS$ compatibility,Purchased for my Grandson for PS4.15-year-old grandson is very happy with the HD.Easy to connect and no performance issues at all.He basically loaded about five games on to the hard drive and has no issues playing games located on the 2TB Hd.
3613,5,good storage to buy under 100,this works on anything on the ps5 to the pc to everything
3614,5,good,didnt need call Tech Support its works really good
3615,5,Excelente calidad.,Excelente calidad.
3616,1,Will not work,I have tried for over a week now to get this drive to work and it will not. I downloaded a “toolkit” for the drive and I still can not load files onto this drive. I am very disappointed.
3617,5,"accurate description, functions well",Works
3618,5,Great productI i,I used this to back up my hard drive. Worked very well.
3619,5,Good value,This portable external 1TB is quite good. No complaints.
3620,5,WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS,"This is the BEST product I have bought for my game consoles yet so fat. This device adds extra storage capacity to your gaming devices wether they are; Xbox, PlayStation,Switch or PC. It is a small and very light device that fits in your palms. It also has a simple setup just plug and play that's it. This hard drive was about $70 with taxes and shipping I got it delivered overnight and now I have an extra 2tb storage for my game the only thing I have an issue with is when I set the device up it says it on contains 1.85tb and not 2tb Wich was wired but this thing is great if your short on space with that 500gb buy this it is great no cap 🧢"
3621,5,Practical,Super easy set up and good amount of storage for my ps4
3622,5,Compact,Servs my needs perfectly
3623,4,Not exactly 2 TB ... 1.81TB but close enough.,A for Effort. 🙂
3624,5,Great backup storage,"I have purchased 3 drive so far, one 1 gig, and two 2 gig drives. I use these as backup for my three computers to store documents, pictures, and various other media. I use one to travel with with my laptop, I have found these to be fast and reliable, and very compact to travel with. I am considering buying some for my daughters for their home computers as they are always running out of space and trying to burn disks which takes a while."
3625,4,Good HD,Good HD to use as a backup.
3626,1,Piece of Garbage!,"Never have I had an EHD THIS BAD!It can only copy small bits of information at once... when it decides to actually work.Will either start to copy data then slow down and freeze till I try again, or just randomly disconnect itself from my pc, causing me to unplug and re-plug it multiple times."
3627,1,So mad,It doesn't work for a PS4 like it says it's supposed to and this was a Christmas present so thanks for messing that up
3628,1,Slow possibly fake,The it is extremely slow and thr barcode sticker on back is blurry as if a imitation product with my past experience with other authentic itemsBarcodes and number on them are clear.
3629,5,Great product,Moved all of my files to a safe backup device
3630,5,"Buen servicio al cliente, excelente producto","Buen servicio al cliente, excelente producto"
3631,1,Slow customer support and had to pay to return a defective drive,The drive was defective.Hey it happens.But what chaps me is the terrible slow customer support at Seagate.Emails take a week to respond to . I had to pay to ship the defective drive back.Nothing good about that.I will avoid buying from Seagate in the future due to their slow customer support.
3632,5,Great for my ps4,Does work great
3633,5,small and handy with lots of space,"I needed a high capacity drive to transfer a lot of data from an old drive while I formatted it. Worked like a dream, speedy and large!"
3634,5,It’s what’s up.,This thing is wassup like that’s wAssup
3635,5,A very slim storage device,Great for back up.
3636,5,Very nice,Awesome. Can carry it anywhere. Might get a smaller capacity one for on the go n keep this one in the safe.
3637,5,Love the Product,"So far has exceeded every expectation, we will see in a couple of years"
3638,1,Bad customer support and the product never worked!,After sending 3 messages for product support and no response. This product that has never worked or their support! Very unhappy and will not by a Seagate product again.
3639,5,2 TB or not 2TB That is the question~,"Need more space for your bits and bites?Computer sluggish, maybe a tad irritable?Well, now you have the answer that has plagued mankind for at least a couple decades.Buy one or more and solve all of your problems,no kidding!"
3640,5,Great HDD at a great price.,It's just a little thick and it took me a bit to find a case for it
3641,1,terrible,"Out of nowhere the thing just stops working, lost everything I had on it. unable to get it running again. lost a few hundred bucks"
3642,5,Works,Works for my ps4.
3643,2,Broken after less than 4 months,The product was working perfectly for 3 months but then stopped working and made a beeping sound. This product isn’t very trustworthy and after months of trying to figure out how to fix it I gave up.
3644,1,Not compatable with older Mac OS,"This drive is NOT compatible with older Mac OS (operating systems).Look at the snapshot I took. Minimum OS required is 10.9 or later.The drive looks pretty flimsy, cheap and vulnerable. They really cut costs on this one."
3645,5,Good,Excellent for the Xbox series S
3646,4,Works for my drone footage,"When I purchased my laptop, I did so with the intention of using it a completely different way. So when I got into flying dronesband other photography shortly after I found that my machine storage was lacking.I picked this up after hours of comparing seagate to other brands. So far its working well.While not as fast as my machines solid state it is works very well for all of my storage needs. I'm not a professional photographer by any means and with this size I can hold a lot of photos 4k video.My machines ram and processor can handle the transfer fairly quick and I can diconnect it when using my computer for experimental software.I could not connect it to an Android device.I picked this size in case there are any disc errors. That way things can physically moved around on the disc."
3647,5,XB1 Compatible.,"Got it for XB1, works just fine for extra storage."
3648,5,Great value for the amount of storage you get,"I've had this drive for over a year now, and it has performed flawlessly. I mostly use it as a backup for my desktop and laptop PCs, both of which have SSDs as their primary drives. It gives me piece of mind to have a reliable mechanical drive in case those drives fail.Also, because of the form factor it's easy to story and take with me, if I need to."
3649,1,Very Slow,First thing package is not good. No soft cover around the package and there is a damage to the box. I am not sure it is from Segate (no where in the package it states segate). Coming to coping files from laptop it taking so long. It's copies @ 8mb/sec which is very slow. Overall unsatisfied with the product.
3650,1,Dead after 3 months,Average write speeds at best. Drive just started clicking and no longer can be read after only 3 months of sitting on my desk. It was not ever moved one time and still failed in 3 months. Garbage.
3651,5,Great,Great
3652,5,It's perfect just not big enough for me,I just needed more space than just 1TB
3653,2,Failed!,Drive failed 2 weeks after very light duty.I have data trapped on it now. Seagate is giving me a new drive and going to TRY to recover my data off of this one but I’m VERY disappointed with the quality of the portable drive I used with my laptop.
3654,1,Lost everything will not last,This was a backup for all my 4K drone/go pro/DJI videos. After only 4 months is started beeping and will not be recognized by my laptop. Lost all my videos. Terrible product do not recommend. Priceless memories and once in a lifetime experiences gone forever
3655,1,"Out of the box, not functional","When you plug it in, the first step is to select the Mac path or the PC path. Both buttons created an error message: ""can't open, the application may be damaged or incomplete."" I called support five times. Each time either no connection or connection dropped after two rings. Sent it straight back to Amazon. I have no patience for this kind of nonsense."
3656,5,It's serving it's purpose,"My son was gifted one, liked it enough to buy his friend one.He says he has had no problems with it and its doing its job.Used with XBOX."
3657,5,Excellent for gaming,"Bought this (2 TB) for my Xbox. Easy to setup, as the prompts pop up as soon as you plug the EHD in. So far, I’ve added 25 games to hard drive, and I’m still barely at 40% capacity. Would definitely recommend"
3658,5,X-Box,"My son uses this for additional x-box storage, and he loves it."
3659,1,Slowest Transfer Ever,"This is the slowest drive I have ever used. It’s slow transferring from another drive into it and opening any files takes forever, video clips occasionally don’t even open.I constantly have to reboot the computer to see if it engage better with no prevail. For the past 10 years all the external hard drives I had purchased has been Seagate, but with this one they had lost credibility on their ability to manufacture large capacity hard drives. Do not purchase this one"
3660,5,Me encanto,Excelente productos los garantizo
3661,5,Perfect for Upgrading PS4 memory,Works great
3662,2,"Extraordinarily Slow Writing Speeds, Larger File Storage Space Required","I backed up my wife's 4TB Seagate Portable External to this 8TB drive, and then copied from the 8TB External, to an 8TB Seagate BarraCuda Internal 5400 drive.Both transfers involving the 8TB External (product I'm reviewing) were VERY SLOW, taking a couple days to move less than 4TB.And yes, it's this product, as I read and write on the other two drives involved, and they are very quick and consistent with large file transfers.So I'll keep it, but only as a deep storage backup, hopefully never having to use it.Also... maybe I don't know enough about storage technology, but I found it strange that the exact same files took up MORE space on this 8TB External, than it did on my 8TB Internal BarraCuda drive???Something to do with the storage software maybe? Either way, it's less efficient at using the available space it would seem, another mark against it.Definitely NOT a great drive, but it's cheap space, and I'll keep it for that reason."
3663,5,Amazing,Would buy more
3664,5,Portability,Remarkably state-of-the-art quality. Delivery was first-class. Would buy from again. Thanks. Exquisite seller.
3665,5,Great for gaming,It was so easy to setup for my boys ps4 they were very pleased
3666,1,Doesn't work with MAC,Bought this and it clearly says in description it works for Mac but it doesn't. It's configured for Windows only.
3667,5,Perfect if you need some extra storage for any console or game system,"I have an Xbox one S with 1 TB of memory which can hold a lot, but I play a lot of BIG games that take up a lot of memory (Warzone, APEX Legends, etc.) I highly recommend this external hard drive. Now I have 3 TBs of space instead of 1. Also, they come in bigger sizes like 4 & 5 TBs!"
3668,1,Reliability,Purchased this and copied our data over to it from our failing NAS unfortunately a day or two after that the drive quite working - it can be sent back to Seagate but don’t fill comfortable doing that with all our data on it. So unfortunately a waste of money.
3669,5,Perfect fit,"Love how lightweight, yet, protective it is."
3670,5,Have to buy new cords if take it with you place,My son's ps4 station game system
3671,5,Great for ps4,Great for my ps4 holds tons of games. Had no issues connecting it.
3672,5,great,"the price was amazing for this product, worked perfectly for PS4"
3673,5,Perfect,"Plenty of storage, works w/ my xbox one very well. Had for a few months now."
3674,5,I would invest in one of these,More room on my x box finally
3675,1,Bad read and write speeds.,The read and write speeds are about 1/3 of what they advertise. 3 iterations of 5 GB.
3676,2,"Its a seagate barracuda compute. These drives are known to fail, mine did after a year of owning it.",Dont bother
3677,5,Works,Good
3678,5,Good and easy to install,very easy plug in and use
3679,5,WORKS ON XBOX ONE!,GREAT STORAGE SPACE FOR THE PRICE! WELL MADE!
3680,5,Works amazing for Xbox!,"Love it for my new Series X. Make sure you don’t plug it in until the Xbox is on and at the Home Screen, otherwise it won’t read that it’s connected."
3681,5,GREAT QUALITY,I needed this hard drive for several photography classes and it has worked perfectly. I haven't encountered any problems with it.
3682,1,Defective and poor support,"I bought this, put it aside for when my current drive was full, and finally started using it a few months later.When I did, it turned out to be defective.It copies for a minute at normal speed, then drops to almost nothing, then fails.Every time.Every write fails.I contacted their support, and after jumping though hoops for 30 minutes, they offered to replace it - if I paid roughly 1/3 of what I paid for it initially in shipping costs.It did not go bad.It did not fail.It did not get damaged.It came out of the box unusable, and they want me to foot the bill for their mistake.This is not how you accept responsibility for your mistakes, Seagate, and my next purchase will be elsewhere."
3683,3,Fast but noisy.,"It has an internal fan which is very noisy and the only way to stop the noise is to give a few hits to the drive until the noise is gone, very disappointing. Other than that the drive is good and very fast."
3684,5,I LOVE THE HARD DRIVE EASY TO USE AND LEGIT STORAGE CAPACITY,Legit storage capacity and it's easy to use!! 🥰
3685,1,Piece OF CRAP….,"Had it for a month and all seemed well and working properly. Well last night it decided to crash and I can’t get any of my saved stuff off of it now. I’m heartbroken… please stay away from this, you’ve been warned and judging by some other reviewers this is happening often."
3686,1,Buy Something Else! Anything Else!,Worked for a day. Then it broke and I spent hours with customer service troubleshooting. Started working about a week later. Dead for good just after it couldn't be returned.
3687,5,Good,Good
3688,5,So much space,I can fit so much on this! I highly recommend
3689,1,Dead in less than a year,"I bought this product at a brick and mortar shop and it died in less than a year. Used it as a back up drive and now it's all gone. I remember Seagate in the 90s being a trustworthy brand, but with all the mergers and private equity bs since then, brand doesn't mean squat anymore. Except when you know you can't trust them, as in the case here. Do not buy.1 star because it can keep paper from blowing away when the window is open."
3690,4,Nice 👍,Nice
3691,5,It's a 2TB hard drive.,It's a 2TB hard drive. It does exactly what a 2TB hard drive should do. I wasn't expecting much else. Good product lol.
3692,1,Poor Quality. Lost first set of data due to corruption,Poor Quality. Lost first set of data due to corruption
3693,1,Xbox wont recognize it anymore,"I have many games in my account and downloaded most if them on to this hard drive more specifically the 2TB one. It worked great the first two months then it stopped reading the hard drive, it would work after unplugging it a few times but eventually even that stopped working and i even changed the cable to be sure but it still wouldn't read the hard drive at all and i had to re install the games back into my console, sadly my console only holds 4 games so i wasted 60 dollars plus the extra for fast shipping all for nothing! Very disappointed!!!!"
3694,1,Keeps disconnecting and very slow!,I have less than 1TB of the 5TB of space available on this hard drive and despite that it still has very slow writing speeds when trying to download/update applications (especially games). This would be ok for files if it weren't for the fact that the hard drive shuts down/disconnects itself from the pc constantly. I have it placed to the side where nothing is ever in contact with it and everything is plugged in but suddenly the storage just disappears from my pc and I can't find a good solution to keep it active/connected. Many other people are having this same issue so please don't spend your money on this. Seagate is usually a pretty reliable brand but this external hard drive is useless with it's slow write speeds and continual disconnect issue.
3695,4,Still downloading all my games to it!!,I'm still downloading all my games to it!
3696,5,has a regular 2.5 segate mobile hdd inside,i dismantled this for the 2tb hdd which performs well. upgraded my xbox one x from 1tb to 2 tb and made this portable into a 1tb incase any one was wondering about disassembly
3697,5,Simple and easy.,Nice hard drive and easy to format for a Mac
3698,5,Works fine !,Came on time and I only bought it for my brother to add games and documents to. I didn’t need to do any formatting just started using it when I got it.Will update in a month
3699,5,Easy to format on my mac,I teach digital classes and I need to be able to store and move large file easily rather than bring my laptop. Sea gate has always been a good brand for me.
3700,5,this was purchased for our son,"this was purchased for our son, it was to his liking"
3701,5,Easy to use with excellent tech support,"I have a Mac computer so a software conversion was necessary before I could use it, but the tech support made it simple and easy."
3702,3,Doesn't work with iPad Air 2021,"Works fine as a backup harddrive with my PC.The AC adaptor is plugged all the time to supply power but no luck to get it work with my iPad Air 2021.Tried to plug it in directly with USB C cable, and several USB C hub with no success.Tried to search for solution on the internet but nothing works for me.Anyone can get this work with your iPad?"
3703,5,Great Device,Absolutely love it!
3704,1,Constantly disconnects,"There is something wrong with this device. I bought it to provide more storage for my Xbox One, and for some reason it often disconnects and does not show up as a connected storage device. The power light is on, but apparently no one is home. USB cable is firmly in place."
3705,4,Not for the Xbox one,Bought the 18th version for the xbox one. Selected it to be formatted but never appears as selectable storage.
3706,1,"It advertises as a 4TB, But it's actually a 1TB.",It advertises as a 4TB but it's actually only a 1TB
3707,1,Arrived inoperable,"Out the box, attempting to run for the first time was met with failure.=(.I asked for a replacement and the second one had the same problem. I don't think these are compatible with mac despite having a ""Start_Here_Mac"" preinstalled. Each time error notification, file is incomplete."
3708,4,Works with iPad with proper formatting,"As we all know, apple loves up charging like crazy for additional storage and hates giving you the ability to use external storage of any kind. Well, I needed external storage for my photos that would be compatible with my iPad for ease of use. It took a bit of tinkering, but I got it to work. The storage capacity is exactly what I expected, my only complaint and reason for not giving 5 stars is the relatively slow writing speeds. If you need something super fast this may not be the best option, but for affordability if speed is not a major concern this is a great option!"
3709,5,Si,Es perfecto
3710,1,Stopped working after 4 months,"Purchased 2 of these, 1 for each of my boys to use for game storage based on recommendations in the description and both have stopped working after the 3 month warranty. Purchased in July and its barely December and neither operate."
3711,5,Husband's early Christmas gift,So far he has no complaints. Tech husband's there expensive but hey what they love is worth it. Arrived fast
3712,5,El producto corresponde a lo ofrecido por el vendedor,Muy buen producto
3713,5,Works well,Works like it spost to. I've had it for a couple months without any issues. All my games on my ps4 are digital so I transferred all of em to the external to leave space on my actual system. Will update if it breaks or malfunctions
3714,1,Not for next gen consoles,It doesn't work for xbox series x/s. I bought two of them and it says they're to slow for my console
3715,2,Not compatible with Mac!,"I ordered this item twice to make sure it wasn't just one defective drive, but both times, when I plugged it into my Mac, the Mac symbol was ""x""ed out and I was not able to format the disk or use it. The Windows option was available though, so if you're on Windows this might work fine. I have no idea.Returning it twice was an extra errand to run and a waste of my time, they should change the description on their Amazon page to exclude Mac as a compatible operating service for this product."
3716,2,Only Worked for a Year,This hard drive lasted me a few days over a year.It’s flimsier than my other portable Seagate which I’ve had for several years and still works.It disappointing that quality is so poor now.
3717,5,As expected,Plug and save. Easy to use.
3718,5,5 star,It came in perfect condition and it works perfectly best thing I bought
3719,5,this is NOT a Hard Driveit IS a DVD disk that is writeable???,this is NOT a Hard Driveit IS a DVD disk that is writeable???I wanted an external HARD DRIVE !!!
3720,1,Not compatible with ps4,Does not work with ps4 as advertised.
3721,5,Its great,It works great!
3722,1,Very bad quality and unreliable device,Dusk became damaged on its own in 4 months of use. Very disappointing
3723,1,Does not work!,Does not work - keeps saying driver error!!!so disappointed!!
3724,2,Ridiculously slow!,This is a super slow drive.It makes a noise when you plug it in (no doubt a moving drive) and it's about 1/4 th the speed of my previous drive. That was about $100 (about 2-3 years ago) and 1TB storage...but this speed is ridiculous.
3725,5,Reliable and does the job efficiently,It is perfect to store all the photos and videos in order to unclutter our pc's hard drive.
3726,5,Plugged it in and it works.,Works
3727,5,Great product!,Bought 2 of these for my sons to house their gaming info on and they love them! I love them as well! Highly recommended!
3728,1,It totally does not work.,This is the 3rd Seagate that either never worked or failed after a few months.Unfortunately I bought it months ago to use on my Christmas iMac....so it is too late to return it.
3729,5,Good external hard drive,"I have filled this drive to capacity and have had great results, it is fast and delivers error free data."
3730,4,"Works with my PS4, but at a price.","Overall, pretty good purchase. I bought it for my 250GB PS4 I've had since 2016. Back then games weren't all 150GB downloads and I didn't think I'd need more. So I got the hard drive to have more than 3 games available. The problem is, I also have a Bluetooth headset and the transmitter is a USB stick. When I connect the headphones and the hard drive, my sound cuts out entirely. Even if I turn of the headphones and remove the Bluetooth dongle. The only fix is to restart my PS4. I read in a forum that the old PS4 doesn't put enough juice out to run both USB ports simultaneously and that's my issue. So keep that in mind if you find yourself in a similar situation."
3731,5,Very nice,It works very good had no problem with it
3732,1,Less than worthless,Plugged this in.The drive stayed live until a few seconds after I registered it online with Seagate.Then it died.Working life?Less than one minute of use before it died.
3733,5,Wife says its the best she's had,Wife says its the best she's had. Likes the long handle.
3734,5,Something we all must have,very useful I needed I arrived very quickly recommended.
3735,2,Just stop working.,"Bought it back in June my first one and after a couple of months two stop work. I only have one game save on one and all I can hear is a clicking sound. The other just had some doc pic store on it, luckily nothing important."
3736,1,Won't eject,Won't eject after endless troubleshooting
3737,5,hard drive,mucha capacidad de espacio y buena calidad
3738,5,So far great Hard Drive!!,"Really not much to say except that although I’ve only had it about a month, it’s working as expected.I loaded 14Tb of movies on it. Loads them quick and they stream great."
3739,5,Nice and easy to use,Easy to use
3740,5,Really great for the price!,"I was too excited to finally get a Terobyte for my Xbox One, I was tired of downloading games and deleting them to download more, now I have about 50 games and I can’t get enough. I got a whole terobyte for about 40 bucks, while people I know payed up to 60 to a 100. If you’re getting this while it’s cheap, it works good and why not buy?"
3741,5,Excellent,Just what I needed
3742,5,Gotta be Savvy,Great device with good storage. I used it to store my daughter’s wedding video on!!It took sometime to get it to cooperate. I have an excellent computer guy who provides great tech support to me. Make sure you get MAC FOR MAC and The other for no MAC.It was hard initially to set up with windows whatever. I even requested a return but after working with it; it was very successful and excellent portability.Room to add more for their future life. Thank you very much!!! It came from Taiwan 🇹🇼 or China 🇨🇳 and you know they are very smart when it comes to technology and math!!! I’m very pleased with this product!!!
3743,5,Important Info,The hard drive needs to be formatted to use on your Mac computer. It is better to call 1-800-Seagate and have their tech walk you through the process.Seagatetechs will tell you trying to do it following online instructions is not the best answer.It takes very little time and it works like a charm when you follow the excellent service Seagate provides by telephone for installation.
3744,1,Crashes and Ungodly slow,"This product just is not worth your time. I bought a 1tb drive, and all it has done is constantly crash (so that i have to power off my pc, unplug and replug in the drive, and completely reboot), as well as the worst read and write speeds of all time. My peak downloads on the drive only handled only about 150kb/s, making life just that much more difficult. Dont get this drive, go western digital or something else"
3745,5,Can't store ps5 games of course but fantastic for your ps4 library.,Great storage for your pile of digital and physical ps4 games. You wouldn't want to store ps5 games on this even if you could. So far so good. Unplugged it at a bad time on accident and it worked perfectly fine with zero data loss.
3746,5,As advertised!,"It came on time, is small and easy to navigate, very happy!!!!!"
3747,5,Awesome,"This is by far the best piece of equipment that you plug and play and you're on your way, to great gaming."
3748,5,Had to have it,Works great with my PS4
3749,1,Didn't Even Make it Past One Month,Not even two weeks later. The clicks of death start sounding off and it's a struggle to get it to read anything.
3750,2,Could not use for XBOX One,"Tried to use this to expand an XBOX One (original, not -S or -X) but, while the XBOX recognized the drive, it would not allow it to be formatted for game usage.Could for media storage, but not games; the XBOX thought it was too slow or something.Got a different brand drive and plugged it into the console and everything went fine.Returns on this drive were easy through Amazon, though."
3751,5,Speed,My son said it holds a lot and it downloads games super fast but remember soon as u disconnect it all the games be gone
3752,3,Works but I can already tell I won't be using it much.,"I'm using this to back up about 1.5TB. It's slow. It's going to take all day to transfer. I was transfering folders and right around filling up half of the drive it started going REAL slow and after a bit I thought it was going to freeze up. I defraged it and it started going the speed it normaly should go. Transfer completed. But there was another issue. I tried to shut it off/eject it safely and it doesn't do that easily? It kept saying it was busy, it wasn't do anything. I tried another time it finally said it was safe to eject but the drive was doing something... it had the blinking busy light going and I could feel the drive it's was doing something. So I gave it sometime and it wouldn't stop blinking. Finally I disconnected the USB and it made a squeek like a mouse? Like I stepped on a small animal? haha. IDK. As long as the next time I use it I can transfer the files off it at least once than it served its purpose."
3753,5,works with ps4,Got this for my PS4. Hooked up easily and was ready to go. Finally don't have to decide what to get rid of so I can download something else
3754,5,Great Backup Drive!,I use these for back up and for main use through a USB 3 connection.
3755,1,"When I'm Asking For A Mac, I Don't Want A PC","This item is for a PC, not a Mac."
3756,5,Great device,I am very glad I purchased the drive.It was needed and it met the need.
3757,4,like it,nothing to dislike as it works as expected
3758,1,"Less than a 3 months, it failed. The drive make bi","Less than 3 month of light use, it failed. It makes noise internally and not work!!!! What a cheap piece!"
3759,5,Works great with PS4.,Purchased as a additional storage for PS4.It was plug and play.
3760,1,Does not work as advertised,"It is being advertised that this is compatible for external storage for a playstation. However, it is not compatible with my PS5. Complete waste of money on my end."
3761,4,"Yes,so far so good.It worked no problem.",
3762,1,Fake description,The product description says its mac compitable. but it's not.
3763,1,That it works,Could not get it work. It is now an expensive paper weight.
3764,1,Doesn't work on MAC computer and Amazon refuses to offer a return . Total ripoff,"This claimed to be for MAC and android. But when I signed on to set the preferences and clicked on the link for MAC , I got a message saying this link didn't work and was inoperative. Then when I tried to fill out the form to return this hard drive, Amazon said it was unable to handle the request. Try back later. Total ripoff. Do not buy this portable hard drive.And it looks like Amazon is in on the scam."
3765,5,Producto muy bueno,Este producto es muy bueno ayudar mucho a la hora de guardar y transportar archivos
3766,5,The cord that is included is not compatible with the PS5.,The hard drive works great with my PS5! But the cable that it comes with is not rated for the speed the PS5 requires. Other than that 👍👍
3767,1,"Very slow, writing failed after 1/3 full","The drive worked for about a week. When it worked, it was so very slow, there is literally no reason for this drive to use USB 3.0, USB 1.0 is sufficient for the drive's read and write speeds. The USB3 thing is just a gimick, making people think the drive is faster than older USB 2 drives. I was being patient though, since I don't expect to use the drive for anything other than backing stuff up occasionally. And then after filling it about 1/3 full, the drive started giving ""unexpected device errors"" when trying to copy files. Even windows 10 disk scan failed, due to a device error. This error causes windows explorer to freeze up, requiring a reboot to make my PC functional again. Returning the drive.Yes I got really unlucky with this drive. No, you probably shouldn't expect the same thing to happen if you buy one. Its just dumb bad luck that mine died. I would have kept it if it didn't die on me (because I'm lazy and I hate dealing with returns), but it isn't good enough for me to want a replacement. Definitely far too slow for any real day-to-day use.Maybe it dying is a blessing in disguise.The 1 star is me being angry for wasting so much of my time on this drive."
3768,1,Did Not Come With Power Adapters,Now I have to find or buy my own. Will update this review but I haven't even been able to use the drive because I have no way of powering it which is very frustrating.
3769,5,Brand Name Recognition,"For no other reason but experience, I prefer Seagate for its reliability and peace of mind. If the data is important or valuable you want to protect it.Because of the drives size (5TB) I can back up multiple PC's using the System Image method.That way I can choose which PC image to restore.It works great!"
3770,2,Super slow transfer speed,"Honestly I am a little worried if the data I put onto this hard drive is safe, since the transfer was so slow (Many hours to transfer 30GB).It makes me nervous if the product will be reliable...which was the purpose of buying an external hd in the first place. I feel like I need a backup to this backup now."
3771,5,Good amount of storage,"Stores enough for movies, music, and tons of photos. Drive is very stable and sturdy."
3772,1,Return process is not effective,Returned because it was not large enough space wise. UPS store on 524 lost it apparently as I have never received credit. Sigh
3773,5,"Small, light, great performance","The product photo made it look much bigger, but it is small and light and super easy to use.We now have 50 years' worth of digitized home movies on it."
3774,3,Poor quar,Won't do automatic backup; have to copy files manually. Now having it less than a year it has died.
3775,5,Nice,It’s a Christmas gift
3776,5,Good hard drive,Works well with my computer. Good price and portable.
3777,3,Didn’t work with PS4,“This usb storage devices file system is not supported”
3778,1,Does NOT work with Xbox series S,"Even though it’s labeled for Xbox, the Series S did not show up as available storage. Very frustrating, have to shell out for their proprietary card. This drive did not work. Will be returning."
3779,5,Thank you so much,Its nice even material that will is cheaper plastic.. but its good had a fast transfer some files like movies.. to my phone.
3780,4,Great for storage,The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there is a program that loads every time I open my computer. It is supposedly there to automatically store any new information but I would rather do so myself. I find this program an inconvenience. Maybe if I had a newer computer this wouldn't take so long. My other external hard drive did not come with this annoying software.
3781,3,Not for PS5,Excellent storage device but does not work for PS5.
3782,5,"Lots of storage space, easy to use",For price buy 2
3783,4,you get what you pay for,"this is overall a great device. lots of storage so i cant really ask for much more than that. its sleek, discrete, and just a non noticeable device that fits right in with my system.myurk about this is the cord length. its maybe 18 inches. short, cant really put it anywhere except on top on your tower. im fortunate to have a slot on my desk that it will fit on but im disappointed in the length.it does its job 2TB for 49 bucks aint bad at all"
3784,5,Works great for PS5!,"This saved me from maxing out the storage in my PS5. I’ll admit that at first I was a bit skeptical because of some negative reviews, however, it worked great. It’s even small enough to hide. Overall, the installment was easy, you just have to reconfigure it into a external storage device, which you are automatically asked when you go into the settings in PS5/4."
3785,5,Amazing !,"Meet expectations, even arrived a day early, very satisfied!!!"
3786,1,Did not work on macbook pro laptop,Did not work when plugged into new macbook pro. Said damaged or incomplete when I tried to set it up.
3787,5,great overall,"love those. Bought 5! Great price, they work great. Had them for a while before and never had a problem.Unless you go SSD those are the ones, light and slim for travel. Amazing: 5TB. No complaints"
3788,5,Excelente producto lo recomiendo,Cumple con el propósito deseado
3789,5,Great for Xbox One Slim,I installed on my Xbox One Slim and games run better than internal. Great way to expand console memory.
3790,5,Very useful for Xbox one X.,It works fine so far.It has all my game pass games downloaded
3791,5,Great HD at reasonable price,I needed an external drive to help me recover data lost on a Western Digital MyBook.This Seagate worked as advertised for a reasonable price.I've placed it on my home network where it works well.
3792,5,Met expectations,Met expectations
3793,5,"Great product , Great price !","Very happy with this product , good price also ."
3794,1,Worked for 1 hour then no longer detectable,"I bought it for my xbox It worked fine for one hour after using it, games download fast could play them with no problem but then suddenly my xbox could no longer detect it I tryd everything the internet told me to do nothing worked and it doesn't work on my pc ether"
3795,3,EVERY other device has to be disconnected to be registered,EVERY other device has to be disconnected to be registered.
3796,5,hard drive,"I like the size of the external drive its not too small or too big its perfect but I thing I'm depressed about is that when I started using it, it was showing 1.8TB instead of 2TB so something definitely is wrong about that. I think I do need back a gift of a 2TB on Christmas day, LOL."
3797,2,Difficult to operate and requires extra software,"I bought this product because I have a great experience with one of these hard drives. However, the software changed and it is very difficult to operate. It takes forever to install the software and hard to understand. I guess you need to be an expert to deal with this one, not user friendly at all. Besides, it requires extra software that you have to buy with acronis. For the seagate disk wizard you need a serial number impossible to find. Customer support is impossible, the website a rabbit's hole, and if you want to use your warranty, you need to return the product as received. So hold to your package, but best, stay away from this product."
3798,5,Good Hard Drive For Gamers,"I got this to add storage to my xbox one, it only has 365GB which isnt enough for me, i got the 1 Tb and it added 931GB and it was perfect for what i needed, highly recommend!"
3799,1,"not compatible with mac, still waiting on refund???","not compatible with mac, still waiting on refund even though it was received back by seller"
3800,5,It's small and east to carry and worth the price on black Friday.,I have more memory and that's all I could ask for. Came exactly as ordered.
3801,5,External HDD. Does what it needs to do.,External HDD. Does what it needs to do.Use it for the Xbox One and can be reformatted to use for the PS4. Can't complain.
3802,5,Easy to set up for Xbox,Plugged it in while my Xbox was in and took 10 seconds to set up. Would recommend
3803,5,Perfect,Perfect for my Xbox one
3804,4,It's 1.84 TB not 2 TB..,Was promised 2 TB not 1.84.
3805,1,Died after 8 months,Bought in February 2021. It shorted out and lost my backups in November 2021. Just absoute trash.
3806,5,"love love love this , why didn't I get this sooner",red dead redemption 2 and ark and other big games didn't even phase the memory of this card it's amazing and I love it when I go to my nephews to play with him I can take it with me any large game I have from my xbox one it can hold without taking up space wow this thing is awesome had to pay 2 hundred for it but hey it's worth it this memory card is awesome .
3807,2,Just be prepared for issues,-Looks/feels cheap and flimsy (like one small fall will total it).-Formatting issues (mac)I purchased this item to move/store raw video files from another external. Here are frequent issues that I came across.-Will randomly hide files no matter how long they have been on the drive (files will return if you unmount and remount drive).-Cannot transfer more than 2 folders (around 12gb) at a time or you will randomly get a error 36 message (unmounting/recounting drive and then transferring 1 folder at a time is a work around).I've showered the internet to find any/all solutions to these problems and only a few helped intermittently.Overall I would not recommend this product if you plan on backing up large amounts of photos and videos. This is probably great for small occasional file storage.
3808,5,Epic Gamer,It's easy to setup for console which is what I used it for and it wasn't hard at all
3809,1,Broke quick,Stopped working after putting 2 files on it. Froze my whole system and it stayed frozen for a day before shutting off. It no longer connects
3810,4,Great product,"Using it on my Xbox 1 and it was supper easy to install, I’ve had it for about 1 month and no issues"
3811,1,Drive Failed after 1 use& reasonable replacement process -DON'T BUY THIS ITEM,Drive Failed after 1 use& reasonable replacement process -DON'T BUY THIS ITEM
3812,5,Vale la pens,Vale la pena
3813,5,Linux GOOD,"I left the factory format and did NOT reformat to ext2 or ext4 . And it works perfectly. Reformating to Linux on 2 other 2Tb drives ruined them, for me.Note: Ubuntu and variants have a kernel level issue of file speed. This drive , like all others, correctly started a backupvat 90Mb/s then slowed to under 3Mb/s after 4gbs. That is NOT the drive's issue."
3814,5,"Mine works great, highly recommended for PlayStation","I liked mine, it was harder to to redownload my games but that’s my Wi-Fi’s fault not the hard drive."
3815,4,Working well,I got two of these drives they're both working well I've been using them for three or four months. I don't have a lot of faith in Seagate but the deal was too good to pass up when I bought them. You won't get the full drive size it's about 10 gigs short.
3816,1,El cable que vino es incorrecto y no funciona el disco,
3817,5,Seagate,Great product
3818,1,HORRIBLE COMPANY- DEFECTIVE 2 OUT OF 2 DRIVES,HORRIBLE COMPANY- DEFECTIVE 2 OUT OF 2 DRIVES!I lost so much time with these drives! They should stop selling defective drives!first one worked for about 2 hours and second one COULD NOT WORK AT ALL!!!!!WOW. STAY AWAY
3819,1,Bad Drive,"Only used drive for storage, rarely plugged in and used. Maybe plugged in 30 times since the purchase. Then nothing. I cracked the shell and tried connecting to another drive controller. Also tried to connect to the mobo. Bad disk. I would not recommend this drive!"
3820,5,So easy and so much storage!,"I have a 500 gb back up that is 7+ years old. I was getting scared that it may crash and wanted to get that backed up. Backed up my back up,backed up my phone and my computer and it was as simple as plugging it in copy and pasting. All that didn't hardly touch the space available. I still am running Windows 7 and it work perfect! Highly recommend! I did pay the extra 15 bucks for the help to restore it if needed."
3821,1,Product defective,Doesn’t work
3822,5,Excelente para consolas y/o equipos de sobremesa,"Muy buen disco duro, lo llevo usando un par de meses y hasta el momento todo perfecto 2tb más que suficientes para la Xbox funciona a la perfección"
3823,5,Working great,"I use it for mac. Fast speed, lightweight. Love it."
3824,1,Stopped reading after 11 months,Product had lots of storage but after being in a well ventilated area and not moving and is dust free only being used as an xbox external storage and it quit reading after 11 months I can't say I'm surprised with the price.
3825,5,Great price and get what you asked for,I love it it was true to it's description
3826,4,I’m a little salty,I bought the same hard drive five years ago but with 5 TB and now it’s only a fraction of the cost with more storage. Great product though
3827,1,DON'T BUY!,"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this product!I used this one time, put a bunch of files on it and next time I plugged it in it was completely dead. I've been talking to customer service for over an hour, they're still trying to figure this out. I've always used a different brand, but need another external in a time crunch. This had great reviews and overnight shipping. NEVER AGAIN will I do that. Hoping my lesson learned will help save you the hassle."
3828,1,replaced my 5T HD when mine locked up with a RECERTIFIED,"Customer Service (??) replaced my 5T HD when mine locked up with a RECERTIFIED (used) drive and charged me $132.50 MORE THAN RETAIL for a used HD. Good bye, Seagate."
3829,2,Slow transfer speed,Videos
3830,5,Came quick!,"Came quicker then expected, decent sized, it's great!!"
3831,5,PERFECT PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY,"THE PRODUCT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION, WITH A FACTORY SEAL AND ITS OPERATION UP TO THE MOMENT IS THE BEST I HAVE TESTED, VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE, WORKS PERFECT ON PS4"
3832,5,Works exactly as expected.,Works exactly as expected.
3833,5,Awesome product great speed,Awesome product great speed. 50gb transferred in 5min
3834,5,My Go To Drive,Just what I needed to keep all my music and personal files. This definitely was a great investment!
3835,1,Dissapointed,very junky - after 2 week sit would not connect to my computer anymore and we had to send it out to retrieve the data.
3836,5,It set up easy and worked well.,"I liked the fact it arrived fast, and was so easy to use."
3837,5,Excelente producto,"Hasta el momento el producto me ha funcionado a la perfección, lo recomiendo."
3838,1,Avoid this company - highly unreliable,"I wish all the positive reviews hadn't given me a false sense of security with this company. I thought it was as simple as I'd just save old files on this, keep new files on my computer and I was protecting myself. Two years later with minimal use this just stopped working. And this is apparently very typical with this company. High failure rates where the drive just stops working out of the blue and they will do nothing about it, which completely defeats the purpose of protecting your data. Highly recommend people going elsewhere. I will never purchase anything from this company again."
3839,5,Easy to use!,My grandson loves it.He was able to set it up by himself and he was able to save a lot of games on it.
3840,3,May have trouble connecting to ps5,"Amazon helped me get in contact with the company’s tech support to fix the hard drive awhile back, so far I’ve had no problems with it happy I bought it"
3841,1,Seagate Portable 5TB - FAILED in a year!,"Not only the money I paid for it is wasted, but I also need to pay now to restore all of the 5TB of content that is on it! The light on the hard drive keeps blinking, but it is not seen by any of my Mac computers. I am a commercial photographer with over a decade of experience, and it is one of the 2 hard drives out of 20 that I have, and the other one that failed at least lasted for over 7 years. This POS failed in a year, so I can't return it and get my money back to buy something that actually does what it is built for. Don't risk it, get a TOSHIBA or WD."
3842,5,SO HAPPY with this Drive!,"I purchased this drive, and it didn't work. There was a corrupt file. I requested a replacement. I was sent an email that the replacement had shipped (within 24 hours) before I had returned the broken one (postage paid). WOW!The replacement worked flawlessly...and still does. It saves, and loads, files fairly quick. I am happy with the drive and customer service. I will be purchasing a second."
3843,3,Comes with 181Mb less than advertised!,"I ordered 2TB, and got 181mb less. So in order to get closer to the full 2TB that the description says, one must delete the manufacturer software folder etc.Other than that it works right out of the box for Windows 10 OS. It's plug an play.Testing the transfer read/write speed to see what the OS tells me for different size folders and files. The transfer rate varied from 862kb to 65 MB/s - see attached. As others have said, the transfer speed is slow! 10GB took about an hour to transfer."
3844,1,Can't play xbox series x games off this,Can't play xbox series x games on this fair warning
3845,5,Quality,Functionality
3846,5,Works great.,I got this for an extended storage for my PS4 and it works perfectly!
3847,5,Good for gaming storage,Good product it’s worth buying
3848,1,"Purchased for PS4 storage, Not working",Any clue why my PS4 isnt registering this? I purchased this bc I needed more storage :/
3849,5,"Reliable, affordable, and reasonably fast transfer speed (~140-150MB/s)","I suspect that the reviews complaining about transfer speeds were using the wrong USB cable or something. I just tested mine. It ranges from 140-150MB/s writing to the drive from an SSD using USB3. That's pretty decent for a disk drive.I do video work and use lots and lots of HDD's. I've had a fair amount of drive failures, but never have any of my seagate drives failed, no matter how cheap. Take that for whatever you will. The ones I've been buying are mostly the 8GB ones."
3850,5,It's fine,"Works as intended, plug in and you have storage."
3851,1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC,"These are technically ""Mac compatible"", but very obviously created for windows users.You have to take extra steps to reformat, and even after that it's glitchy and unreliable.I've wasted so much time on google just understanding how to change settings to make this ready for basic use.Save yourself the trouble and buy a different brand!!"
3852,1,Broken,"Bought 2 of these for me and my boyfriend, mine shows up in device manager but will NOT initialize in disk manager and no fix online I can find works. His worked for maybe 15 minutes until it cut out. DO NOT BUY THIS."
3853,5,"Bought for my kid, but he loves it and has never had a problem with it.",Works great.
3854,1,"Cave drawing instructions, no support on weekend, not work on mac",I was looking forward to using this external drive for time capsule but when plugged in everything was grayed out.The instruction manual is samethe amount of information you wouldget from a cave drawing.Just a little bit more from their website.But no trouble shooting.No support on weekends.Too many other options out there to go through this hassle.
3855,5,Buen articulo,"El articulo llegó tal y como lo ordené, es la capacidad que esperaba y llegó en buenas condiciones"
3856,5,Easy-to-use,Just plug it in a transfer files
3857,5,"A terrific portable, external hard drive at an excellent value.","So easy to use!! It keeps me from procrastinating copying from phone or camera; I keep the copying current. It gives peace of mind for 'preserving memories', as I use the product mostly for storing cherished videos of beloved and adored pets and human loved ones."
3858,4,Compatible with PS4 games only,"The media could not be loaded. Most people told me it wouldn't work, got it anyway, not mad. I have more PS4 games then PS5 anyway. Now I can have my old games on hard drive and the new ones on my console. Overall a good purchase."
3859,5,Great gift for your gamer boyfriend! (:,My boyfriend loves it! I got it over a year and a half ago and he hasn’t complained once! Provides an insane amount of storage for all the games! Since I bought this he has yet had to delete a game so he could download a new one! BUY IT!!!
3860,5,Excelente producto,"Su precio es muy bueno y su almacenamiento ni decirlo. ademas la respuesta de interacion es excelente con los datos almacenados, yo lo recomiendo"
3861,4,Good buy but I didn't get what I paid for,"I needed this product as I was running out of storage on my ssd and I wanted to play storage intensive games such as the cod series and so, but when I received the drive it was missing 200gb sure that's not much for a 2tb hdd but still that's around a 10th of the storage and that's 6 dollars that I didn't get, still worth it though"
3862,5,Great deal!,Just what I needed for my Mac. Works great!
3863,4,1.8 tb storage,Not the full 2 tb of storage
3864,5,External storage,Purchased for my grandson's PS4. Shouybe adequate for game storage.
3865,5,Works great for XBox,"I bought this to expand the storage of my XBox One S, and it works great. Only took a few minutes to format and it was ready to use. Transferring installed games over was easy, but took a while longer. Once they were on the drive they installed and ran seamlessly, didn’t even notice they were on the drive instead of on the machine."
3866,5,Wonderful,"I like this expansion drive, it works so easily with my PS4 Pro. With the default items on it, it only has about 5.8TB. But that's still way better than the default 500GB-1TB most consoles have. Only qualm I have is that I wish the USB port was in the back with the rest of the cords. It looks funky sticking out the front."
3867,5,Wish I had gotten one sooner!,"The media could not be loaded. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.My DISH Wally receiver had a pop up note that I couldn’t use the DVR option without an external hard drive. I bought this from Amazon and plugged it into my Wally receiver with the cord provided with the external drive. It prompted me to call DISH to activate the DVR option. I called them and it only cost a one time charge of $40.00 for my entire account, and now I have a DVR!So awesome!I wish I had bought this external hard drive sooner!"
3868,5,Awesome!,Gave me extra storage space for all my apps on my smart TV. 10/10 would recommend.
3869,5,Recomendado,"un Disco muy recomendado, tengo un año de tenerlo y no me ha dado problema, esta marca de discos externo la recomiendo"
3870,1,Don’t waste your time,I started using the drive today to back up photos from a wedding. It crashed within a few hours. Will be returning to get something else more reliable
3871,1,Should have gone with a SanDisk,"Barely lasted a year, lucky I keep backups on everything with my Sandisk drive. I did fill out my warranty and stuff to get it replaced but they want you to pay for shipping, by that point you might as well buy a better brand. Also, notice this issue was common with other consumers, so do back up your storage when using this drive."
3872,1,Stopped working after on second use.,This drive failed in the middle of a data transfer. Seagate support sent me a label to return it to their lab for data recovery and said they will replace it as I'm within the one year warranty. I received notice two weeks ago that data recovery failed...but have heard nothing about a new replacement. I've been on hold with customer service for 45 minutes trying to get info after their online chat rep said they could do nothing to help. Dissappointing.
3873,4,Value for your money,"While not the fastest way to backup your Mac, it still is a good value for your money."
3874,1,Not Worth Your Money,"I am a Graphic Designer and Photographer and I dabble with music production, This product has lost over 14000 of my photos, 60 Beats with embedded .wav files and the tech support was horrendous. Please I urge you DO NOT WATSE your hard earned money on a product that will ultimately lead to your artwork being lost"
3875,1,"Waste of money, stopped working after 2 months",Stopped working and can’t return.
3876,5,Works Great,No issues after 6 months...
3877,3,Se calientan como el demonio.,"Es un buen producto, solo debes tener cuidado con sus temperaturas. Recomiendo que instales Hardware monitor si la temperatura de tu habitación es superior a 30 grados o si estás en verano."
3878,1,"Stopped working on Mac OS after 2 months, total loss",This drive abruptly stopped mounting on my Macbook shortly after I started using it full-time for backup. Tried every forum-suggested troubleshooting idea I could find for three hours to no end. Looking like it'll be a total loss. Be warned :/
3879,5,Great storage,I’ve never used one of these before and this was easy to use and quick to download everything in my laptop. I feel safer knowing my stuff is backed up in case my laptop is broken or stolen
3880,1,False Advertising - NOT DESIGNED FOR CONSOLES,"After having to be a bit of a butt to Seagate to help me figure out why my hard drive started failing all of a sudden, I found out the hard way that this particular hard drive is NOT DESIGNED for consoles! If you check out Seagate's website, they have external hard drives that are designed to withstand the beating they get from the constant on and off of an Xbox or Playstation console.This poor hard drive lasted less than six months on my Xbox One console. I've had the same external hard drive since I bought my first Xbox One back in 2014, but it was heavy and kinda clunky, and I honestly just wanted to upgrade to something smaller and easier to manage. Out of the 4TB of storage, I had over 2TB of games and save data stored. All of it was lost when the damn thing busted.Seagate really helped me out with this one, unlike the company that sold me this device, who never bothered to respond to my messages on replacements. Luckily, the manufacturers have some big boy pants and allowed me to swap the dead hard drive for an Xbox-compatible device. If you are wanting a hard drive for consoles, DO NOT get this one! It will die on you. It may take a few months or even a year or so, but it will die. Don't send another poor hard drive to the grave because some idiot retailer decided to try and make an extra buck."
3881,5,It works as advertised,"It does the job.Have not had to use it to recover yet, and gives me peace of mind to have it"
3882,5,Great product !,"Works great, I got more space now, really easy to set up and use !"
3883,5,This will hold a lot.,"Recommended by my brother the tech wizard, I got it to hold the 100,000 photos I have and probably all the ones I'll ever take."
3884,3,"Useful for multiple charges, but takes days to charge unit","This has saved our family multiple times, but it takes days now to charge the unit. Have tried multiple ports and cords."
3885,1,Awful,Not even the simplest games can run on it. Read speed is horrendous.
3886,4,What’s up yo!,Great storage when I pour in on my face
3887,5,It actually worked right out of the box.,The inboard hard drive in my DVR quit. I plugged this new unit into the jack supplied for the purpose and it works flawlessly!
3888,5,Works great,Went thru 2 desktop computers. Easy
3889,5,Excellent,Excellent
3890,5,Good,Everything is good so far. About a year of using.
3891,5,Great product for a great price.,Easy setup and no issues
3892,2,Be Carefull.,"You shouldn't have the option to select 18TB, if it isn't that large. When the package arrived, the box it was in was 16TB. But even then. when I plugged it in, it only had 14.5TB of storage. While who needs more storage than even 5TB, the price still goes up from the 14 18. Just order a 14TB and you'll probably get a 14.5, since the 16TB and the 18TB don't seem to exist."
3893,5,Works Great the First Time,Worked great the very first time.Just plugged it up and it was ready to go!I now have room to run Windows File History for daily backups.
3894,5,Lots of Storage,Very easy to you and literally one touch!!
3895,2,No charger included,Dislike the fact I had to go find a charging cable
3896,5,Works as expected,Sad to say 7 games took up way too much space quick on laptop! Anyway works as advertised point click and ship. Bigger the file longer the swap but set it and watch a movie
3897,1,Unreliable. Crashed my Entire Computer,"Worked fine for 1 week. After a week, the icon that appears next to the drive in ""file explorer"" disappeared. (It turned into a default windows ""unknown file"" icon rather than the Seagate icon that it was originally). Weird, but it still worked fine, so it was okay. One week later, I go to open file explorer, and file explorer hangs for a minute, then my entire computer crashes. This is a very high performance desktop computer that I only purchased a little over a year ago, mind you. I turn it back on, launch file explorer, and it crashes again. I turn it on for a third time, unplug my hard drive -- since I figure it might have something to do with it, and file explorer launches completely fine. Luckily I was able to access the files from the drive on another computer, but what if I couldn't, or what if I didn't have access to another computer? I can't risk putting any more files on this drive. It is unreliable and I will be returning it."
3898,5,Fits for XBOX ONE,good for xbox one
3899,1,Crash and burn,Crashed and lost all family photos I had just moved to the drive. NONRECOVERABLE in only two months with minimum use.Horrific purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3900,1,Died after one year.,Hard drive is dead exactly 1 year and 9 days from purchase. Thousands of photos potentially lost. Now need to figure out a way to restore them.
3901,4,storage hard drive,"it states that it is already set up for mac, but it is not, you have to reformat it and it is not as easy as the description indicates.I finally got it set up, but it was actually set up for a pc and not mac."
3902,1,Not for PS5 - Undetectable on PC,"We purchased this as a hopeful external storage for our son's PS5; however, it is not compatible with PS5 and quickly became undiscoverable even as we tried to back up PS4 games to create more storage. Very thankful it quit BEFORE we transferred any important data.It also was undiscoverable on my PC when I tried to explore further and possibly reformat.I do NOT recommend it."
3903,5,Affordable Storage for your Computer Files,"I bought my daughter the 1TB Seagate Portable External Drive a few years ago. She has really used hers a lot. I needed a way to keep/move/access a large number of files for my job. After looking at reviews, prices, and storage capacities, I decided to buy the 2TB Seagate External Drive. It’s about the size of my hand and has a charging/USB connection cord. I’m loving it, but wish I had purchased a protective case for it for peace of mind. That’s my next purchase. Great portability and customer support. Easy setup."
3904,1,Not compatible with updated games?!?!?!?,"How is it possible it is not compatible with updated games, games update constantly and I got this for my new Xbox console Series S and it again, not compatibly with new games, only older ones that aren't updated. What the"
3905,5,Excellent,Everything I expected n needed.
3906,1,Dislike late night deliveries,"Amazon delivered late, after bed time, like after 9 pm so a coffee machine and two computer hard drives say in a wet cold environment all night... out doors.Not at all impressed. There's a lidded bench they left it on top of. Didn’t bother to put INSIDE OF THE BENCH...This drive arrived DOA. Reads as a SCSI and fails to mount. Can't format, can't partition. Absolute JUNK"
3907,5,Useful for storing steam games,After a year of using this I haven't had any problem with it the connection is good and it holds just enough of my files and games. Not bad.
3908,1,Do not buy for Series X. Good for older games. Says “not fast enough” for newer games. (BF2042),"Allows you to store next gen games, but not play them. Says it’s not fast enough to play next gen games. Do not buy for Series X."
3909,1,Not able to set-up so waisted my time and need to set-up for MAC,"What is this? i thought it would be plug in and ready to go but its a pain and the instructions are a joke. no support and no way this is made for Mac, must figure out configuration before even able to set-up??? why!!!returning it. waisted more than an hour of my time."
3910,5,Must buy!,I got this because I go between a lot of computers for work & this is a great resource for all of my needs. Make sure to follow the installation instructions which shouldn't be a problem even for novice computer users.
3911,4,"Know what you are buying.It is SLOW.But, that is ok.","We are all used to super fast SSD's now.I remember not too long ago things were only HDD.That being said, I much prefer the speeds of SSD's, M.2's, etc..HDD's are slow, especially small 2.5"" 5400RPM drives that are external at that.I have M.2's in my system for my main drive, and a media storage drive.Both drives are 1tb.I wanted a 2tb drive to be a backup of the whole computer.I don't need the drive to be fast.I will put files on it from time to time.And if I ever put a large amount of files on at once, I will just let it run while I sleep.For me, it works for my purposes, and, saved me $150 over a 2tb SSD which range around $200 right now.Would the SSD have been nicer in some ways?Sure.But for me, not a big deal, and, saving $150 was worth it.If you need your drive to be fast and able to transfer large files quickly, then do not get a HDD external drive."
3912,5,Yes!,Works great.
3913,5,Plug and play,Was perfect for my ps4
3914,1,NOT formatted for MAC.,I specifically bought this for a MAC. I plugged it in and then there is a process to get it to work with the MAC. I do not have the time needed. False advertising.
3915,3,Don't get for xbox,Hooked it up to my Xbox and it says I can't play games on it
3916,5,Very good!,"Very good product. Came on time. Not as fast as I was expecting in writing files, but good enough!"
3917,1,disapointed,Is not compatible with my ps4pro like it was listed because this is not a 3.0 usb drive like it is said to be.I was lied to but am using it for backing up my laptop which is not why i bought it in the first place sadly.DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR GAME SYSTEMS.
3918,4,Works with Xbox series s,You can not play series x/s games directly via the drive. But you can any previous gen games no problem. And you can easily swap games between each drive
3919,1,Stopped working now has an error and wont restore,can you help me my hard drive stopped working has an error when booting up. wont let me restore it.
3920,1,Broken,"Recieved it broken, drive made a bunch of noise and would not let me transfer data over to it. I think shipping damage was most likely, which is surprising because it was well packaged."
3921,5,Did the job,I used this hard drive to transfer recordings on my Dish TV Hopper 3 which went bad to a new Hopper 3. It did what it was supposed to do.
3922,5,No problems,"4.54/5 TB out of the box. Excellent packaging. Super fast delivery. Very easy to unpack, register, and use.Moving files over from one external drive to another (USB port to USB port) is not the fastest, but gets the job done."
3923,5,Not easy to use,Bulky and not easy to use and had to return
3924,5,Honest Review,"If you're someone who only needs an external for backing up files to save room on your computer then this is a very stable choice. I've left externals of lesser quality than this plugged in for 3-4 years without a issue so I have no doubt you could do the same with this one if you wanted to but it's not recommended as there are much better externals for that. I backed up about 800 soundboard concerts & it took about 2 hours which wasn't a problem as I didn't need it to be any faster. As far as bang for the buck is concerned, This is a great overall value."
3925,5,Resourceful,It’s super useful
3926,5,Everything I wanted,This hard drive works easily. I use this for my Xbox Series S and I just plugged it in and was able to move games to it right after. And everytime I've removed it and plugged it back in there's been absolutely no issues. It's been half a year and I would say this hard drive is reliable. I was actually scared to make this purchase bc I've never bought a hard drive before so I thought using it might be complex or the device might be faulty. But if you're considering buying this I highly recommend.
3927,5,Great value for size,Like it's size and capacity. This is my third.
3928,2,Not a long term use device...,"It was fine for a couple months, but then the port started coming loose. It disconnects from the computer if anything even touches it. Now that the port has started working its way out of the device, I am lucky to get any kind of read for the stored data.I'm thoroughly upset because this wasn't exactly a cheap purchase for a product that performs like something disposable would..."
3929,3,"Having problems recognizing the drive ,intermittently recognizing.","I like the size and whenot recognize the drive in the port,I try to update the drivers my pc is new so I doubt it is the pc, also I use the hard drive on another pc same results. I brought 1 and but had to replace it for this problem, now the second one is doing the same,if I can they can tell me how to fix this problem I will keep both of them because I have data on 1 of them ."
3930,5,Excelente,Excelente
3931,5,Works well with MAC,"Great price, quality drive."
3932,5,Nice and compact,Does what it's supposed to do.
3933,5,"Great product, great price, fast delivery",Easy set up.So far has been a very much needed back up external hard drive for me.Very Happy!
3934,3,Slow,This drive is slow. Very slow. I am using it to work with video editing. It is horribly slow for rendering. Very disappointed. Avoid this drive.
3935,5,Solid External Hard Drive,"I accidentally dropped my 2TB Hard Drive, so the internal system was damaged, and I could not retrieve all the files and folders I had (thankfully, this hard drive did not store any important information, and I did not put a lot in it). I decided to purchase a new one for work purpose, and it totally does it job. A really good thing is that I do not have to merge two partitions, since there is only one in this hard drive. For my previous hard drive, I had to do so, which was quite complicated. Overall, I am satisfied with my buy!"
3936,5,Handy to have for backup.,Gives peace of mind.
3937,1,"Must be formatted to work with a MAC.. Does not work ""out of the box"" for a MAC","It has to be formatted to work with a MAC: complicated, aggravating procedure that I could not get to work, probably a good product for a PC but be aware that it does not work with a MAC ""out of the box"""
3938,4,Great product,Great product
3939,5,PS4 storage,"It has worked great for my sons PS4, no issues yet and it has done its job perfect. Haven’t had to call tech support or use them so no rating on that."
3940,1,5TB Drive - Fails Under Heavy Load,"Not Recommended. Very poor performer compared to my other Seagate One Touch drives (4TB and below). Have had it replaced under warranty...replacement is even worse.Connected to a USB-2 system, I could transfer a 1.5TB data set to the drive (~25 MB/s) w/o issue. It took 12 hours, but no issues. Connected to USB 3.x systems (tested on more than one) and attempt totransfer the same data set (write-to), drive will start with sustained speeds of 75-95 MB/s, then become unresponsive within 3 minutes.Only solution is to physically disconnect the drive before systems would detect it again.Other lower-capacity Seagate One Touch drives (e.g. 1TB/2TB/4TB) have worked perfectly for me. Suspect the first one to be a fluke.Seagate sent a replacement unit under warranty.This one works without failure. However, it is capped at ~40MBps.40MBps is -2/3- max transfer rate of USB-2.Look elsewhere. Seagate clearly failed when trying to bring out a 5TB One Touch drive.Now, I'm outside the return period with Amazon and stuck with an inferior unit."
3941,5,Essential for Series S Owners,"Owning an Xbox Series S, the limited storage for huge next gen games is a handicap on my expansive backlog of 360 and One games I would like to play.After purchasing the storage drive, I have 54 games installed and 40% storage still available, about a terabyte still with the drive/internal storage combined. Best purchase I've made for the console."
3942,3,Not PS4 compatible,"Received portable device next day, but somethings are to good to be true.Was fooled by the Product TitleReview of compatible with PC, Mac, PS4 & Xbox. So returning"
3943,1,External hard drive,It doesn’t work.
3944,5,Perfect backup drive,"Bought the 2TB model to replace an older Seagate 1TB drive that’s been my Mac Time Machine backup. So it doesn’t have to be blazing fast, just reliable. The device itself is tiny - barely bigger than a large smart phone. I’m just amazed at how this stuff has shrunk over the years. Took all of about two minutes to plug it in, set it up as the Time Machine disk and start the first backup. This drive is so quiet, you have to watch the progress bar to see that it’s actually doing something. Full backup is taking about an hour, which is actually a little quicker than the old drive, and for a lot more data. And no power cord means that much less clutter. I’m so happy with it, I just ordered the 5TB version for my wife’s iMac."
3945,5,Small & Compact,"Wow, for this price I will be ordering 2-3 more... exactly what I was looking for."
3946,5,Good enough for the price,Good enough for the price
3947,2,Horrible,"On the second day of using this, the fan inside the hardrive broke down. And I ordered a 2 terabyte drive and it only had 1.6 terabyte storage on. Maybe the one that got sent to me was a bad one because I see many other people saying it is very good. I used my for my gaming laptop as well. Maybe for things like photos and videos it'll be better. For me however I don't recommend."
3948,5,Great value,I have used this product everyday on my Xbox one and so far have not had any issues in 2 years
3949,1,Does not work on Mac,"Says it works on Mac, but it is not compatible with Time Machine, which is the program Macs use to back up data on external drives."
3950,1,no fue una buena compra para mí,El producto no vino en una caja de fábrica y a los pocos días hizo un ruido y antes de que se rompiera le estraje todo los datos mala compra
3951,3,horrible ToolKit software but the drive itself seems ok,"this was formatted exFAT for both PC and Mac (semi)-compatibility, and so i forewent the ntsf format for the old reliable Windows 7 disk image option to backup my hard drive.wish i hadn't.the ToolKit software was horrible.it starts backing up and you can't see any files.initially, you can't get a time estimate to completion.when it did start showing that eta, it was 17 hours.there is also a little pause button and a nondescript x for which you can't find out what it does (no tooltip when noodling over it).if you press either, it exits the backup, no warning.if you Restart, it tells you know.if you then go to Report, which before that would have been unavailable, it will tell you that you cancelled the backup.also, insofar as i was able to find out, if i had gone thru with it i would not have been able to inspect nor work with individual files in the image.so i re-formatted to ntfs, opened the very old but useful Windows 7 make a disk image option, and - only *four* hours later, had a full backup iso.the drive itself seems to be ok."
3952,3,Not the storage given,"The Drive loaded quickly, but even after re-formatting it only showed 10TB of memory."
3953,4,Reliable storage,Ease of use
3954,5,Provides the back up of my important files that I needed,The device is as easy to set up as advertised. Plug and play. The instructions provided several methods of easily transferring my data and also informed me that I could use Windows 10 to create a back up plan if wanted. All in all this external drive was less expensive and data more easily accessible than the 2 TB seagate dedicated back up drive.
3955,4,Good Product,Works well and easily.
3956,5,Amazing for the price,When I built my PC I only added a 512GB SSD so after I filled that up very quickly I decided to get one of these to see if it was worth not having to take my PC apart again.Needless to say it has performed amazing. Sure some storage is already taken up by formatting so it’s not a TRUE 2TB drive. More like 1.88TB. But it was totally plug-and-play. Was able to store all my games on it so I can switch from my PC to laptop with ease!
3957,5,Excellent!,Had previously had a great deal of trouble with a Passport portable drive and the company. This drive has arrived in perfect shape and is incredibly fast. I've just finished transferring files so I can't tell you the function other than I was blown away by it's speed. HIGHLY recommend!
3958,1,Poor product lifetime,Bought this as external storage for an Xbox that only gets used once a week. Only lasted a year before it stopped working. I recommend buying elsewhere.
3959,5,It works,"It seems to be doing what it's supposed to do. Plug and play (or rather backup)I'm not a techie, don't know about speed but it's working just fine, as is all of my Seagate drives."
3960,1,Not 14TB,Pretty lame to spend $300. (Which the price then went down $30 the next day so that was awesome too) for a 14TB portable HDD to then have 12.3 usable. I am a computer tech and network engineer so I understand drives have unusable space for a number of reasons but 1.7TB!?! This drive should have been labeled a 12TB by the manufacturer and sold as such. Because of the almost 2TB of unusable space it’s not big enough for the data I was trying to backup. Very disappointed and will most likely return if possible.
3961,5,Rv drive,Love it! Now my daughter in law can use it for her podcast!
3962,4,"It is not 2tb, it is 1.8 TB",Got this for my boyfriend because he needed more space. Said it was 1.8 TB not 2 TB as advertised.
3963,1,Failed After Little Use,"This thing failed after limited use.Not recognizable by any laptop I own.Changes cables, ports, restarted, Windows diagnostics.Nope!It's dead and took my data with it.Fortunately, it was for back-up purposes.So I am out the $ for a replacement drive."
3964,1,does even show up on the computer,was giving this as a gift. I just found out it doesnt work.
3965,5,Hard Drive,I like how sleek the drive is. It has held a lot of pictures!
3966,5,Reliable,Exactly what is advertised and what I needed
3967,5,It holds alot .,I loved the price.
3968,5,Great external.,Its working perfectly for my xbox one.
3969,5,Get one,"This helped my computer go Faster and easy to use, This is a great buy , Thank you"
3970,5,Size and the packaging was nice too,Wife is super happy the amount and the ease of storage in it
3971,5,Love Seagate compared to WD,"I'll never buy WD again, had very good luck with Seagate External HD's"
3972,5,WORKS FINE,GOOD
3973,5,Legit,Great storage device
3974,5,Everything is as expected,This product is everything I expected.Works out of the box with no problem.
3975,5,Nice,The product is amazing.
3976,5,Price/Quality,Great price & lots of room.
3977,5,muy buen articulo,llego en gran condiciones
3978,5,Good product,Easy and convenient
3979,1,To fragile,I disliked that it fell on the carpet from a foot high and stopped working not very durable !
3980,5,It is the best storage for recorded shows,I have seagate for my Mac computer and it is the best for my Tablo
3981,5,Good product,Good product
3982,1,Didn’t work at all,"I needed extra storage space for my videos and photos. This didn’t work for me at all. It was read only (I have a Mac) but when I try and click on the “start Mac” file it says it’s corrupt or damaged. I tried going in and changing it to “read and write” to see if it would let me use it, still nothing. Complete waste of money."
3983,2,Great value but…..,It was a great buy but it was not compatible to my PS4 and it said it was So I was upset when it was not and had to send it back …
3984,5,Great storage,"I’ve stored movies and it’s great! Over 2Tb and works great on my tv, laptop and iPad."
3985,5,It is small enough to fit in a pocket and it is light and it comes with the cord needed to use it,I like that it is what i ordered and not something else
3986,3,Repair,It’s always needing to be repaired when connected to PS4
3987,4,Great overall experience!,Great resources to always have a backup.
3988,5,Great product!,I got this to use with my PS4 and it's great. I can store all of my downloaded games without having to delete some because I've run out of storage. Highly recommend if you have a large game library.
3989,1,Every time I connect to the machine it says it’s corrupted,"Quality isn’t good, it came with a bug. I feel like it was wasted money :/ can’t trust it will actually save my files!"
3990,5,"works great, pretty fast.","seems to be working great so far, will be great for storing all my 4K drone videos."
3991,5,Good produc,Is exelent for all data
3992,5,Just stopped working,Randomly just stopped working and started beeping non-stop then when I thought it was running again the light started blinking which usually meant it was working nothing was being read and it just beeps non-stop now so don't buy it you're wasting your money it's not worth it go buy some other brand I thought Seagate was top of the line and was going to last longer than it did
3993,2,Stopped working after 2 months,"No surprise, really; Seagate products have been notoriously finicky and fragile; I'd just hoped they'd addressed those problems, but they haven't.Two months into getting it, it was already impossible for my Mac to recognize it, and if it were plugged in during the laptop's startup mode, the laptop literally couldn't start. It would just sit at the Apple logo until I disconnected the drive.Its proprietary tools had so many errors that I couldn't use them, and the Time Machine function=-the main reason I bought the drive--continually deleted older versions, over and over and over, leaving only the version from the current day and the previous day, nothing else. Which makes backing up anything impossible.Steer very, very clear of this harddrive."
3994,5,Works perfectly,"The product has worked, no issues an its really good for ppl who doesnt have alot of storage."
3995,5,Good profuct,"It's fast and has plenty of storage, I was able to back up around 1T worh of stuff in a single shot with no issues."
3996,5,Excelente marca,Muy buen producto y de excelente calidad
3997,5,Finally a portable hard drive that works,I bought two other brands that were corrupted upon arrival before this one. This Seagate wasn't corrupted and works perfectly as advertised. I should have just bought Seagate the first 2 times.
3998,5,Nice,Not sure why people are saying it being slow i transferred 4tb in 4 hrs.Not that big of a deal for a 1 time thing.Rest is normal in w 3.0 usb connection.
3999,1,Does not respond,"I tried multiple ways and times and on different devices to get this drive to respond. I could not get it to work on any computer.Please save your money. Do not buy an external hard drive on this website, opt for an in-person visit to a store.I have trusted this company before because my last portable hard drive, (which I still have and works great), was with them. This one is not comparable."
4000,1,Not compatible with the PS4 as described,My PS4 it's 1T only. The Seagate drive it's 2T and compatible for PS4 (says advertising). And when I try to Format the drive (which you have to). PS4 gives me a message that cannot do it do to the reasons I posted in the picture. That it needs to be 2.5T to 8T to be able to work so... Can't use it!
4001,5,Beats the heck out of subscribing to a storage service.,"It's compact enough to not interfere with my workspace and stores my data. What more could I want? If you're worried about losing data, buy a second one and keep duplicates."
4002,4,Couldn't be happier with it,Shipping was fast.It's just what I needed. I've had it for a couple of months and it's still doing its job
4003,1,Stopped working after a year,"This Seagate external harddrive stopped working after less than a year. I had it hooked up to my MacBook's Time Machine. One day it just stopped connecting. I haven't been able to get it to work. I'm going back to WD external harddrives. I have 3 others, and never had an issue with them. I've had them for over a decade and they're still working to store photos, videos and other documents."
4004,1,This is not compatible with MACs contrary to the way it is advertised,Advertised as being for MAC but it is set up for windows and you have to reconfigure it and then Im not sure if it works.Very frustrating
4005,5,Hard drive,I m glad I got this for reasonable price plus extra storage
4006,5,Great,Still trying to figure out how to transfer things to it but good
4007,5,Perfect portable storage solution.,I have several of these. This one is going to family member filled with family photos.JB
4008,5,Don’t think twice to get it!,"Very good item! The best you can ever have.It’s fast , portable and best for value of money"
4009,1,This thing will mess up your whole console,"I have a $600 Xbox series x I use this for and ever since the day I plugged this garbage in, none of my games will load and my Xbox takes nearly 30 minutes to restart. Even after unplugging the storage device, my games still will not load. Do not buy this product unless you have the money to risk needing to buy a new console. 10/10 would not recommend. It’s also gonna be a long time before I can get my new console, most likely, due to high demand."
4010,1,it doesn't work on Mac without a lot of effort,It just doesn't work
4011,3,I thought is was SSD,"when I searched ssd drives on amazon this was half way down page 1. I guess it proves if a deal looks too good to be true, it isn,lt"
4012,4,Works great for my needs,Works great as my back up.
4013,1,Never got it to function,Never got it to function return window closed without my noticing.Now going to the recyclers
4014,1,Already broken,Didn’t even have it for a month and it started making this strange beeping noise and I couldn’t open the files on my computer. Come to find out it’s fried from the inside. Had a WD back up had to redownload everything. Don’t buy this crap so mad I wasted money. Doesn’t even deserve 1 star
4015,5,Works for Xbox One S,Works for Xbox 2TB fast delivery
4016,5,Does what it’s supposed to do,"Bought this for Xbox One storage - was plug and play.Boom, done"
4017,4,Good! Don’t be in hurry to transfer,"Perfect for movie storage but it is pretty slow to transfer to, be patient!"
4018,5,Good,Works great cant complain
4019,1,Stopped Working after 3 weeks,"This External HD is garbage. It stopped working after 3 weeks. I lost my files, I am not sure how am I going to recover them. Terrible product. Please stay away!!!"
4020,1,doesn't come with usb-c wire,Doesn't come with usb-c wire.
4021,5,Works great,Super easy to use. Price is right too. Works great with PlayStation.
4022,5,Good value,"Came fast, easy to use, and good price"
4023,5,Xbox worthy,Works
4024,4,I want to but I don't trust this drive,I bought 4 drives in the last 2 weeks.I have unboxed 3 and started to back up essential and irreplaceable work data.2 Seagate drives make a clicking sound while in use. Not reassuring!After loading my files onto the drive is obviously too late for me to return them. (Or is it?)I usually use WD and have never heard this nerve testing clicking sound.Packaging:Why are external drives so poorly protected against overworked and careless delivery methods? None of the 4 drives were delivered with adequate protective packaging.Recommendation:Customer: For the sake of a $10 saving don't make a choice you might regret. If your data matters then round up the budget to the next decimal.Seagate / Amazon: Please protect tech better against the tumbles it can take during transport & delivery. I am left wondering if the external drives are damaged or if the clicking is an acceptable quirkiness.My choice:For my peace of mind I will most likely back up my data to WD drives (that are on their way from Amazon) and instigate a return of these Seagate drives.My last words to Seagate: I wanted to love you so much but I just can't compromise security of my files.Farewell.
4025,1,Not reliable,"I had mine for a month and just under two weeks, I connected it to my Xbox one because my last external storage device broke also after about a year. I turned my Xbox on today and the light that has always been on is on but I go to my games and all of it my games that are on the storage device are now gone and I have tried restarting my Xbox and unplugging and re plugging in the cord going into my Xbox. Product sucks and I want a refund."
4026,5,Small and easy to use.,It arrived as promised and is handling the job well. Easy to set up.
4027,1,DO NOT BUY AMAZON DOES NOT HONOR REPLACEMENTS/REFUNDS,BROKE IN A MONTH IT FAILED AND AMAZON REFUSES ALL REPLACEMENTS/REFUNDS
4028,4,Fair deal,"Once upon a time Seagate had great products.This drive has its good points and bad which I will not cover.I had issues with the drive when going from a windows 10 to a windows 8 computer, the drive either would not turn on or you couldn’t open or transfer files.Should’ve bought the over priced SSD"
4029,5,Lots of storage for reasonable price,Lots of storage for a reasonable price
4030,5,"Excellent, easy, efficient tool",So easy to use I didn't need tech support; thus no opinion with stars.I bought a 2nd one for my husband's computer.
4031,5,"Good Price, Good Quality",Good Price and quality.
4032,1,Never got to use it,"I have Mac Pro. Followed the instructions EXACTLY and after finishing setting up, computer want reading it at all. Contacted tech support and their only suggestion was to find a PC, revert back to original settings. “This might fix it and you can try again on Mac”"
4033,3,Doesn’t support all computer,"It doesn’t support the computer easily. It hardly supported Mac later I tried to reuse in other computer, it’s not showing"
4034,1,Received a 1TB when I purchased a 2TB,"I purchased a 2TB hard drive and received a 1TB. Disappointed because now I have to ship it back to get the one I paid for. Didn’t realize this until I formatted the current drive for the XBOX and it showed 931 GB free space. So at least it works, just not the right product"
4035,5,External Hard Drives,The right 5tb hard drive for what I needed on my Xbox One to also go with my other external 1tb hard drive
4036,5,Awesome,"Works like a charm, love it"
4037,5,Great external hard drive for my MacBook Pro!,I had to format hard drive for my MacBook Pro.
4038,3,Its a good hardrive just slow to load things at times,Its a good hardrive just slow to load things
4039,5,So far so good,"It was delivered about two days early, so that was cool. Being able to load more games for the kids has been nice. So far, it does exactly what it advertised and what all the positive reviews said it did."
4040,5,Muy buen producto,"Es la capacidad que requiero, la puedo usar efectivamente."
4041,1,Stopped working,Hard drive stopped working just a couple of months after purchase
4042,4,It’s good on the Series S but…,"It’s a great device for Xbox but the thing is with new gen games like demon slayer you’ll need a expansion card which sucks. The storage device is for older gen games like gears of war, destiny, yo mama lol jk"
4043,2,Works kind of,Gets the job done and holds the amount it should but if you're transferring a lot of files it automatically disconnects and stops the file transfer. Do what you want with this information
4044,5,Simple to set up and it works.,"It arrived very quickly and is surprisingly small. Hook-up was the simplest possible, just plug it in to the console. The PS4 then gave simple instructions to start the automatic formatting and that took just a few seconds. In the past, I've had to delete old games to load new ones. If I wanted to replay an old game I had to wait out v e r y long downloads. I anticipate with this drive I won't have to do that again."
4045,5,Worth the price,Have it for my PlayStation to extend my memory for my system hasn’t failed me yet would buy again if it came up
4046,5,Lightweight easy to use,very helpful to have and not a problem to use
4047,5,Delivery was fast,"Delivery of the item was fast, storage on point as described, no issues so far"
4048,5,Great for my needs,Easy to use and just the right size for what I need it for. Please don’t lose your work. Back it up multiple ways
4049,5,I love it!,It was a little challenging for me to figure out since it has a few steps to install and run in Mac but as soon as I figured it out (thanks to the instructions provided) I couldn't be happier. I look forward to using this product for years to come
4050,5,Portable.,Great value for money. It was easy to use! Storage is great for all of my pictures and videos. I just put my things on it and put it back in my safe. Great product for keep sakes!
4051,5,"After years of intense use, this drive outlived my desktop. Highly recommended!","Not only did this external hard drive outlive the hard drive in my desktop, but it was in regular use on said computer. When the time came to finally factory reset my desktop, I was able to keep every MB of my personal data thanks to the generous 4TB hard drive space. I have years of work data, game data (including a large Steam library) and meme/video hoarding on here. I'm able to download many playlists of YouTube videos at 4K/60fps in mass to this thing without blinking an eye.I love this product so much I recently just ordered a 2nd one. 739GB of 3.63 usable hard drive space and it's still performing like it did Day 1. 5 stars, a perfect rating. To be completely honest, the product is so great I've never even needed any Tech Support."
4052,1,ILLEGAL TO SELL,"GOT MINE AND HAD IT INSTALLED BY EXPERIMAX PROS. LESS THAN 2MO. IT QUIT ON ME, TOOK IT TO THE EXPERTS AND THE DRIVE WAS FAULTY. SPOKE TO CUST SERV BOTH ON SEDAGATE AND AMAZON, TURNS OUT THE DRIVES WERE ""NOT"" SUPOSED TO BE FOR SALE OR SOME OTHER EXCUSE. DO NOT BUY, THEY DO NOT HAVE A WARRANTY. buyer beware!!!!"
4053,5,small unit,"small unit, good capacity, affordable, so far no need for tech support."
4054,5,Awesome HDD (external),"Everything about this item is spot on. Problem is, you can’t play PS5 games off this drive. It’s only for storage."
4055,4,Nice,Sometimes just doesn't appear to be working even though the light is on. (I don't think it's a user error) other than that this is worth it.
4056,2,Never use extended storage devices on Playstations,Now I don't know how nice this thing is to have on a computer and it may work amazing for that but these extended storage devices that plug into your USB ports should not even be allowed to be marketed for video game consoles as they always inevitably stop working. I have to repair this thing once a day and its no exception though. I have owner 3 different extended storage devices similar to this one and all end up having the same problem happen. They work perfectly for a bit but sooner or later you will have to have your console repair the hard drive constantly to the point that it isn't worth having and you feel like you wasted your money.
4057,5,Everything you'd ever want!,"Excellent storage size for the price! It's small and very portable, uses only one cord and the USB 3.0 is pretty nice!"
4058,5,Everything I wanted and more.,Love the product
4059,1,Failed after a year of use,"Have a Mac.Despite efforts with disk utility to erase/reformat, can't get the drive to work.Was using it for Time Machine backup.Thank god I didn't have information I needed to access.Perhaps for forty dollar drive, the quality is just terrible.. expected better from Seagate."
4060,4,Great price,Use this to store servalance video works Great
4061,1,Completely Worthless,"Stopped working 2 months after I purchased it, and it was virtually impossible to reach the company for a refund. Amazon was no help, either. DO NOT BUY!!!"
4062,1,Find another brand,"After purchasing this device and downloading about 500GB of gameplay and movies/shows, the external hard drive causes my whole computer to freeze up to where I need to force shut down or disconnect the device before I can use my computer again. Happens on multiple computers both desktop and laptop. Tried just about everything to troubleshoot. When I tried calling customer service, the guy who I talked to assumed I didn't know anything about tech and gave me BS excuses on what could be the issue along with an attitude. Eventually I had to be the one to bring up the 2 year warranty on the device to which I was told that I will lose all of the countless hours and data put into this hard drive. Don't waste your time."
4063,1,DO NOT BUY,"Do not waste your time. I regret buying this. I had all my games stored on here. Had it for 3 months but only used it maybe 10x. Today I was playing a game, and the game crashed. Thought it was an issue with the game, nope, turns out it was the HD. Restarted my laptop and now the HD won’t detect on any of my laptops, not even in disk utility. Amazon is sending me a new one that should arrive by tomorrow evening, but I’m sure I’ll have the same issue. Just don’t waste your money on this. Big waste of time and money."
4064,1,Unusable most of the time,Would be great if I didnt have to unplug and plug back into my xbox one every time I want to use anything from it. Not the worst thing in the world but how incredibly annoying to have to do this every. Single. Time.
4065,5,Good product,This is a very useful product
4066,5,Super fast SSD!,Arrived early and in perfect condition!This gem is super fast compared to standard HDD units.
4067,5,"Good, bbuuhhhtttt...",Realisticly it's 1.89 ect terabyte
4068,5,Very good,Easy to carry and storage
4069,1,Don’t buy :/,It started making weird noises and wouldn’t connect
4070,1,Junk,Bought this drive at Sams and it never worked.Seagate would do nothing about it.Junk
4071,2,"Failed at 5 months, used only once","Bought this in June 2021, performed HD backup for my macbook, maybe 200GB total. Stored in office cabinet and sat there until today (Nov 2021). Drive is beeping and isnt recognized by macbook. Sent back to Seagate with RMA# for replacement. Would absolutely not trust this with critical data. Im thinking the best option is having multiple copies on drives from Seagate/Toshiba/WD + cloud storage. Cant seem to find a single reliable backup solution."
4072,2,Didn't work on my PS4,will not work with my PlayStation 4 so Basically bought a $60 paperweight that isn't even that heavy lol. don't waste your money like I did get the actual PlayStation version
4073,1,NO CABLE INCLUDED UPON DELIVERY,"Upon opening the package box, to my surprise, there was no cable included inside. How am I suppose to use this without it? I am going to request a refund or replacement."
4074,5,Good,Good
4075,5,it works,it works easy and perfect
4076,1,Broke after 15 days of use,"I used this for Time Machine backups on my MacBook. The hard drive doesn't move, it just sits on my desk. After just sitting on my desk for 2 weeks it has completely stopped working. Poor quality - would not recommand!"
4077,4,It works,Does what the adds say it will
4078,1,Does not play at all with iPhone. The reason I bought it in the first place,Originally to make room on iPhone. Got the drive. Called support because I couldn’t transfer to it from iPhone. $100 at Best Buy to connect directly to the drive and still not one single pic or document in the $70 drive.
4079,3,This is much slower than the WB 5TB passport,"I bought two different 5TB drives and have had a couple days or so to test them. The ""Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive HDD"" is quite a bit slower than the same priced competitor from WD called the 5TB passport. The tech seems the same but in throughput tests in read and write, this Seagate drive or enclosure performed quite a bit slower... nearly 40% slower in large data transfer speeds. Considering both are nearly the same price, within a few bucks of each other and released at about the same time, I find this unacceptable. This tells me Seagate likely cut corners on this to save costs and it's apparent in the performance. Save yourself the hassle and just get the better performing one from WD."
4080,5,Excellent,"Very compact, works great."
4081,5,Cord not 3.0,The cord that was sent my system couldn’t recognize it. Luckily I had one from a previous hard drive I owned and it works fine.
4082,5,Perfect for Xbox One,"I wanted more storage for my Xbox One and this did the trick. I was afraid my data would be erased because of a few reviews I've seen, but after 9 months I've had no issues at all."
4083,1,Doesn’t work.,Never let me format to my Mac.
4084,5,Great storage,Great product never have I ever had so much space on my Xbox
4085,1,Duró un día,El artículo mencionado solamente funcionó una hora. Tiempo suficiente para almacenar en él información valiosa que perdí porque dejó de servir. Ganar dinero estafando nunca será buena opción
4086,1,It wouldn’t connect to anything,Don’t buy
4087,1,"Terrible directions, Idon't have a clue if it's doing anything!",I don't know if I did it correctly or not....
4088,5,"Works Great, Just don't drop it.","I buy one of these every year or so for offline recording keeping and archiving. Works great is able to store 4tb of data.The only issue is that it is still a spinning drive disk inside it, so it is susceptible to harm if dropped, especially if it is still spinning when dropped.of the 10 I've ordered over ht last 5 years, only 3 have gone bad. Mostly due to me dropping them."
4089,1,Questionable at best,"This didnt even come in its original packaging, and the wrap around cord was replaced. I was under the assumption it was brand new but thinking its refurnished.... But as you can see someone had their greasy paws all over it. Its used and crap dont buy this. Pay a few dollars more and get it from a Retail store"
4090,3,"Not the best design, but does the job","I got this to deal with virtual-machine images that were crowding out my work lap-top.As an archive, this works well, but it is too slow over USB to launch a VM image - so problem solved, but not to my ""delight"".I would hope to see power over USB, but a separate charger (provided) is necessary.The charger has many interchangeable outlet interfaces to chose from - which is both considerate and potentially wasteful.The power led is at the top-back of the device, which is designed to stand vertically on its second-longest axis.Not the easiest to view.I have concerns that it will fall over and damage the mechanical drives if the desk is bumped.The disks are noisy when plugged in, and every few seconds when connected but inactive make noise (probably a Windows thing) - I have taken to disconnecting the USB when not actively in use.Won't send it back as long as the disk integrity holds up over time."
4091,5,It's big.The real question is will it work 5-10 years from now.,Very little space wasted. Compact.
4092,1,Defective,Defective when arrived--returning for a full refund.
4093,5,This external hdd works perfectly on ps5,Perfect product to use on ps5!
4094,5,Great value,"Using it for extra storage space for my Playstation 4. Easy plug & play, no fuss necessary."
4095,5,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD,Excellent value. Excellent capacity. Makes back-ups a breeze
4096,1,Too delicate.,"After storing my available data in it, I had to vacuum under my desk and the vacuum attachment tugged on the power adapter wire just enough for the drive to tip over on it's side. Hasn't worked since. Store your data on sd/micro SD cards instead. Very durable and reliable and not so delicate. One could probably handle a 1-2 story fall and be undamaged and unaffected."
4097,4,it works for what I needed,"It's not the fastest thing in the world, but it had enough storage to back up my 1T computer."
4098,1,Joke,Failed within one month of purchase after copying 2TB of data.No dropping or other damage.Under warranty so had to send all the way to Holland 'specailist data recovery' centre for free but took several attempts to send off via UPS as customer service repeatedly did not give me all the reqired info such as shipping labels and invoices.After 2 months Data recovery centre sent auto message to say they could retrive nothing !End of story as far as they are concerned.As far I am concerned they have lost a repeat customer for life.The hard drive was bought in Hong Kong and I have paid for data to be retrieved here after dropping/breaking and I got 75% data back in worst case. I guess the zero recovery is the level of service you can expect for 'free' under the warranty
4099,5,Great for XBox,Great for my x box! super easy to install. I play games without any delay.
4100,1,Physical read errors after using external drive about 10x in 1.4 year.,I used this drive about ten times in one year and 5 months before physical read errors. Very disappointing quality.
4101,4,Very convenient very easy set up especially if you are like me (not hardware savvy).,I love Seagate period their reputation speaks volumes anything I say would only butcher their flawless history of quality.
4102,5,Buena calidad,Capacidad y calidad
4103,5,It is what it is,Using this as an external HD for all my games on my computer since my ssd storage capacity is very limited. I have had no issues loading up my games from there and it was just as simple as plugging into a USB. Recommend it for anyone not wanting to instal a new one into their tower.
4104,1,Stopped working after 3 months,Purchases three months ago and stopped working. I plug it in and it makes a beeping noise and no computer it’s plugged into anymore finds device. I even purchased a second usb cord and that didn’t fix issue. NOT HAPPY and won’t purchase again!
4105,5,Please Note All Users,"Many hard drives, as of this nature, can be laid flat on their horizontal side. This drive contains rubber boots on the vertical side and should be used standing up. You will feel a gyro effect if you hold it at various angles. This tells you that the platters are mounted to be used in this manner to avoid damage to the platter drive mechanism. At 10 tb's, I will be storing the history of how the world was created. Seagate came out of the gate, no pun intended, as a premier provider of computer equipment and they certainly continue to prove that in this unit. Price is hard to beat as well."
4106,4,Seagate Portable 5 Tb is larger and slower than WD My Passport ultra,"I am comparing the Seagate Portable 5 Tb external HDD to the WD My Passport Ultra 5 Tb external HDD. Both external HDD hard drives were purchased new from Amazon in October 2021.I performed a photo folder transfer speed test comparing the Seagate Portable and WD My Passport Ultra drives being written to from a laptop using a USB 3.0 cable. All test parameters were identical except for the drive being written to. WD avg write speed was 95 MB/s. The Seagate was slower with an average write speed of 81 MB/s. The WD is also noticeably smaller than the Seagate for the same storage capacity.We own dozens of WD My Passport HDD's. We recently had several of our older WD drives fail so we bought two Seagate portable drives to see if they might be more durable. Only time will tell, but initial impressions of smaller size and faster write speeds show the WD is superior to the Seagate in these catagories."
4107,5,Great Xbox storage,Works great to download extra games to
4108,1,BUYER BEWARE - SELLER LIES THIS IS NOT MAC/PC COMPATIBLE,I call BS on this drive. It specifically states it is for Mc/PC but it is not...you have to BUY AN UPGRADE or go through a complicated reformatting process. And the fine print of their BS policies state if you reformat drive you voice warranty and you void your one year rescue protection. I am getting a little sick of Amazon not enforcing truth in advertising. You shouldn't have to wait until you get the product to find out it was all a slick lie. And reformatting for Mac/PC should not be complicated but the BS this is spouting makes it complicated. So I either reformat and lose my protections or return it. Leaning towards returning it right now because I am so disgusted.
4109,1,This device is garbage.,Garbage. Don't buy.
4110,5,Just what I expected,Works great 👍
4111,1,Took dump on ps4 less than a month later,Totally quit working in less than a month won’t even show up anymore
4112,4,Good for gaming,I disliked that sometimes it can lag or shut off and not recognize it while in use
4113,5,Buen producto,"El disco corre muchísimo, tiene velocidad para almacenar información de gran tamaño. Recomendado"
4114,5,Seagate Comes Through Again!,"I purchased this drive to add to my already existing 12tb storage, bringing me up 22tb total. I'm not going to bore you with technical data that is only useful to <10% of the population. I've purchased Seagate drives from the 'Get Go' and I have NEVER had one fail me. In fact, I have one upstairs in storage that's so old and so heavy you could use it at the gym in lieu of weights. It still fires right up no problem. This drive is excellent and at a good price point. Enjoy!"
4115,3,Not what I was looking for,"This was bought to give my Xbox Series S more storage. The Xbox doesn’t recognize it as something that can store games to play, so it’s essentially useless with the newest generation of Xbox."
4116,4,Works great,Great product thumbs up
4117,1,Completely quit working out of nowhere,This worked with absolutely no problems for 8 months and then just completely quit working a few minutes ago out of nowhere and it says that it can not be repaired so now I can't do anything at all with it because it won't even let me format it so I just lost everything on it.
4118,5,So far so good,So far it’s working out great
4119,3,Poor Setup Instructions,"What you get these days is a short bit of marginaly useful information in 37 languages.Maybe there are legal disclaimers. The online support is difficult to find for your case. Then you call customer support and after you get past the gatekeeper bots and 30 minutes on hold you finally get a live person and then the call is disconnected.Only chat is left and chat support is horrible. I did get it to work but a 20 minute job ended up taking 2 hours. This disk will be used for Time Machine backup on a Mac.Performance/speed does not matter to me, nor portability.I have another Seagate still functioning after 3.5 years. Hopefully I never have to contact support again."
4120,5,Great,I got this as a gift for my friend that doesn’t have enough storage on his laptop. He says it’s pretty good and now we can play more games together :P
4121,5,Like having an extra computer...but better,I love the portability and safety and the price is good too!
4122,5,Great value,Great value and super easy to use. I moved all my pictures off of my laptop to free up hard drive space and to back them up
4123,1,Plugged into computer and it didn’t read.,This didn’t work at all! Might be because we have an Apple computer but it didn’t mention that it wouldn’t work on an Apple.
4124,5,Android phone photos/videos to external hard drive,"I am very happy with my purchase of the 2TB Seagate external hard drive. I wanted to be able to transfer all of the photos/videos from my phone to the hard drive and it worked very well and was simple! There are many questions/answers saying that this isn't possible, so I just wanted to write a review in case someone else wanted to do the same thing as me. All that I needed to purchase in addition to this hard drive was a USB C to USB 2.0 OTL cable adapter. I plugged the hard drive into my phone. There was definitely enough power from the phone to power the hard drive. Using file manager (Android), I was able to transfer about 5,000 pictures and 1,000 videos to the hard drive (there are youtube videos on how to do this if you need help! You do not need to download any extra apps or anything to accomplish this.).I can now view/use the contents of the hard drive on my laptop as well. I also use Google Photos to backup this data, but wanted to have them stored somewhere offline. Overall, great product and simple to use!"
4125,5,Great for PS4,"Works well so far, when first plugged in was told it's not compatible with the PS4 system. After a quick reformat the unit works great. Came with the sata 3.0 cable and instructions/care information. Advertised as 2TB but after format it seems there is a bit more space than that (originally formatted for Windows with drivers). Would recommend highly for anyone who prefers to download games instead of having the physical copies."
4126,1,After 2 weeks of it being plugged in it started not reading and blinking.,It was all good for a very short amount of time. Got all my games on it easily and was more than a good buy if your looking to play all your old games for two weeks. It began to have issues reading and playing the games put on it. A day or two later it started blinking and beeping and there was no way to reset it. A day later I went to try it again and plug it in and it would kill all the power to my Xbox. Thrown in the trash on to better.
4127,5,failure,Not even six months in and the damn thing failed. I'm so mad right now. I wasted time transferring files from an old computer to this to make it easy then it dies. UGH and I'm past the return/refund day by a few days. What a joke!
4128,5,Great Hard Drive,"I had to move files from a PC to a MAC. No issues, transferred all my files effortless over to my MAC."
4129,5,Works great with PS4,Bought it for the PS4 works great 4TB holds a lot more than I though probably should have bought the 2TB
4130,5,Lasting very well,Holding on strong for a long time now. Great purchase!
4131,1,A year later - dead,"Third and final seagate drive. I have had it for a year, in a case, never dropped. Today I heard the beeping. It's fried again. DO NOT BUY SEAGATE"
4132,1,"When I bought it and connected it immediately, it was already broken. It was a meaningless shopping.","When I bought it and connected it immediately, it was already broken. It was a meaningless shopping."
4133,2,Knockoff??,"Does not feel solid. Seems to be very cheaply constructed. OS did not recognize the drive, had to connect and disconnect multiple times. I don't trust my data on the drive. I purchased two of them and both act the same with multiple computers."
4134,5,So much space,"I didn’t notice how 2TB was until my friend told me , great friends college students who need extra space for work and I use it for my sims mods"
4135,5,good,very good
4136,3,No es tan rápido,Para pasar información como sd de video cámaras demora mas de lo normal
4137,5,Great External Hard Drive,Great size & price !
4138,5,This is perfect,Works just fine
4139,5,No issues,Hooked this to my Tablo for tv recording. Works great.
4140,5,Easy,Fast and easy set up.
4141,5,Works,Does it’s job and it still had storage !
4142,4,Good for the price,Purchased because of price. Was not thrilled with durability. Made of plastic and felt it could break easily especially if traveling with it.
4143,5,Great hard drive,"Great hard drive for your ps4,Xbox 1,or pc.. plug any play with no power cord"
4144,5,My go-to,"As a photographer and videographer, I need a lot of storage space...These are my go-to backup drives...I have like 6 of them.(knock wood) they haven't failed me yet."
4145,1,Poco fiable,"Parecía ser una buena opción calidad/precio, sin embargo al primer trabajo de copia empezó a tener fallas y al llegar a los 2TB dejó de funcionar.El tiempo de devolución es muy corto para este tipo de dispositivo."
4146,5,Good for ps4 games on the ps5,I have a ps5 and this helps me keeping my ps4 games on there and have my ps5 titles my only thing is I wished I got a bigger one for later if I need the storage
4147,3,It works but you have to be careful how you use it.,"Okay so prior to buying this I saw reviews where people mentioned it just stopped working all of a sudden. To be honest I am not sure If that is what I ran into but since it has been over a year I'll assume that is the case for me.For some months I have been unable to access the external after using it as semi-permanent storage space for my desktop. What I noticed in retrospect was that after a long period of it being plugged in it was difficult for certain peripheral devices to be adequately powered(such as wireless keyboard and mouse in my case). After sometime of the external struggling with these peripheral devices at random point in time it would swiftly disconnect and reconnect. I think I was lucky to be around the external when it went down as what happened was the external disconnected and reconnected several times in the span of 10-15 seconds after which when checking on it, it refused to connect.Once in a while I would plug it in and over time I saw incremental improvements in terms of response and as I type this I am now actually able to access my external but it is still doing recovery so I don't have access to all the files yet.Moral of the story, NEVER leave it plugged in, it seems the more, constant up time it has the higher the potential of running into this issue. Hope this helps someone.PS. If you ran into this problem, I am using iBoysoft Data Recovery(trial), it has a recovery action that turns a RAW drive back to NTFS, which is what happened when my drive stopped being accessible, it became ""RAW"" drive."
4148,5,Great price for big hard drive,No issues so far. Have been using for backups for a few months. Will update if there is an issue.
4149,1,trash,Worked for a week then started beeping and never worked again
4150,5,So far so good.,"Thicker than the two TB. Seems to work really well, fast enough too"
4151,3,Not exactly 2TB,It was like 1.98 TB and sure it hold the games but you can play every it holds some ima deduct some points for that other than those problems its great
4152,2,Slow upload and easy to crash,The upload speed’s slow and drive kept crashing when transferring videos and pictures. I highly recommend purchasing a different external hard drive.
4153,4,Great buy,I liked the price as well as how easy it was for me to set up and use
4154,5,great device,this is my second one. you cant get any easier to use. i never actually called tech support. its a simple plug and play
4155,5,Calidad,Velocidad superior
4156,5,The space size,The space size Great I was able to move over my games from the store on the ps4 with no problems with the recommended I would definitely recommend it
4157,5,So Far So Good,"I got this to store critter clips from my trail cam on. So far it's working great, no issues."
4158,3,Acting as if it doesn’t exist.,"I’ve tried to use it on multiple devices, I’ve tried formatting it on 3 devices and it’s still not registering. Worked at first."
4159,5,Great product!,Exactly what I was looking for !
4160,5,just what i ordered,just as described
4161,5,Awesome storage,Quick and easy install. Now my son can download a crap load of games. Awesome product
4162,5,Seagate is great,I've purchased this brand and for me it works great.
4163,2,Way too slow!,VERY slow. Doesn’t pull up my files and I’ve only been using the hard drive for about two weeks. It already seems corrupted. I have used these hard drives for years and they always crap out on me eventually after about a year but this was a new record. Having to now get another one to replace it even though I have barely begun using it.
4164,5,Correcto,Es liviano y cumple con lo prometido.
4165,1,NOT FOR MACS!,The website description says it’s for Macs. Plugged it into Mac and it does not show up. Read the reviews and they say they are not formatted for Macs. False advertising!
4166,5,Replacement,I had to replace my old external hard drive that I had since 2013 which I worried about plus you need an outlet to power it. This is definitely a good upgrade since I don't want to lose important family documents.
4167,5,Should have gotten sooner,This was a gift for a video gamer who just never got around to getting it. They thoroughly enjoy it and wished they had gotten it sooner. Does the job. Has more storage than they need. Good product
4168,3,"Ordered 2TB, Received 1TB","I’m frustrated because I ordered and paid for 2TB and was sent 1TB hard drive. It works fine and set up was straightforward, but I need the other TB that I paid for on the drive."
4169,5,Big Enough ( for now),10TB purchased for a NextCloud backup server.Happy with the cost/capacity price point.
4170,5,High quality high speed,"Love how it allowed my son to be able to maximize our Xbox subscription and get immediate access for lowCost , to allThe games he wanted."
4171,5,Volví a ser felíz.. 🤓🤓,"Increíble la capacidad de almacenamiento, es como tener 5 play station..Sin preocupaciones de hacer espacio..."
4172,5,Compact,Very good for photos
4173,5,Large capacity and small design.,This thing is a power house of space. I use it for my PS4 and it has changed the game. Seagate is a great company and the hard drive is small meaning when I'm on the go I can take all my 200+ games with me. Would buy again and you should too!
4174,5,Awesome,Lots of space and so small and portable. Definitely worth it!
4175,5,SET/ENABLE WRITE CACHING IN DEVICE MANAGER FOR PUBLISHED READ/WRITE SPEEDS....,"I was leery about buying since some buyers had experienced VERY SLOW write speeds.After I got my S together, I remembered to:right click on ""my computer"", (THIS PC),select ""manage"".click device manager tab.click/expand on disk drives.right click on your drive / properties.click on policies.set ""better performance"". (IF SET TO QUICK REMOVAL YOU WILL SEE GREATLY REDUCED WRITE SPEEDS-SEE PIX).With these settings you will enable the drive to give you the BEST performance it is capable of.BUT - MAKE DAMN SURE TO USE ""SAFELY REMOVE HARDWARE"" OPTION IF/WHEN YOU REMOVE THIS DRIVE....P.S.Pictures show speed difference between settings.... AND if/when you get a SSD the 500+ MB speeds are representative of an ADATA SU-800 SSD 1TB DRIVE -(ASIN‎B01K8A29E6)...."
4176,5,Best External Hard Drive,Works as advertised. Plug and play
4177,5,PS4 storage,It holds so much space allowing us to keep out games to play on our PS4.
4178,1,Did not work.,"I tried the external drive and my computer would not recognize it.I called Seagate and after a wait, I got an tech agent, and explained my problem. I was immediately disconnected.I waited probably 15 min and called back. My wait period was to be ""greater than 10 minutes""...quite vague. After 30 min, I gave up and went to the website. Filled our the necessary info and got a ""person"", at least they gave a name as a person, and ""they"" said that they would be happy to help me with my problem. I waited and waited, probably 6-7 minutes for instructions, and NOTHING!Tried typing a response, but would not accept it...probably because they hadn't given me instructions, and the procedure is set at the website. Left the website, went to Amazon to get an authorization to return the item, which I did yesterday through an UPS store.I now have a different company's external drive and it works fine."
4179,5,Great,The item was desirable. Packaging was distinctive. Immensely solid delivery. A++!
4180,5,Pretty cheap,Not hard to set up
4181,5,A good backup drive.,"This is not the first of this brand of drive I've owned. I've heard of issues with QC, but I've yet to experience any.Of course, I'm ONLY using it as a backup drive, so it's ONLY spinning a couple hours, or less, every week, but I'm trusting it with my computer's backup."
4182,4,"Drive Good , Cable defective","Drive was good, but cable that came with it has an intermittent open in wiring. Thereby rendering cable inop."
4183,5,On a Mac - Reformat the Disk,"If using a Mac, as I am, reformat the disk using your Disk Utility. It's easy! The drive connects to TimeMachine no problem. I use it as an additional back-up to my cloud storage. For the price the extra security is worth the money. I'm an author and as such I appreciate having multiple back-ups of my manuscripts.Great little drive and appears to be quite quick backing up my computer. I usually set it and leave it to do its thing. I have the disk security protected. I did not register it so have no idea if their tech support is any good. I just reformatted it and used it. No problems so far. I've done 3 or 4 back-ups so far. I know from past experience that this disk will probably only last a couple years then I'll replace it with a SSD"
4184,5,Awesome,Easy to set up and use. Worked better than I hoped
4185,5,Compact little powerhouse,"I didn't want to go with a no-name brand for my critical work files, and at this price I didn't have to. It's incredibly light and fits in my pocket. I have a WD portable drive with the same dimensions and it weighs twice as much. And with 2 TBI've got all the space I need. Highly recommended."
4186,5,Important,Love it
4187,5,small enough,portable and small enuf to carry
4188,5,LOVE IT!,"I used one drive, but got tired of issues (namely the need for more hard drive space needed on my laptop to perform certain functions...why did I need extra storage space to begin with?Oh yeah...).LOVE this hard drive!"
4189,5,Easy to install,Simply plugged it into my laptop and was recognized. I immediately started transferring files to free up hard drive space
4190,5,Definitely worth getting!,"First time purchasing and using a portable hard drive, and this one is pretty straight forward and very easy to get acquainted with if you know anything about computers at all. I got it for $89 on a sale, but it is still worth the regular price. I will buy again if I need another one for some reason."
4191,1,Not for Macs.,Not for macs.
4192,4,Gets the job done,"My biggest fear is losing all my important documents, projects, school work, and photos. This external hard drive has been able to hold all my stuff without a problem. My only warning is if you have a MacBook you will need to rewire the hard drive to work on apple products. My other caveat is that I need an adapter, for my MacBook air 2020.Otherwise, this thing gets the job done!"
4193,1,Inoperable from day one,This drive did not work at all from day one. problem is I didnt need to use it for a few months after delivery and now its outside return date. Total garbage
4194,5,Great Storage and Zero Problems so far!,Product does what asadvertised. Great Storage and compact. The cord could stand to be longer. Other than that..great!
4195,5,Works well with a Mac,"The documentation to set it was confusing, but the Tech help was great.I made it more difficult than it needed to be."
4196,5,Great product.,5/5 stars.
4197,5,Storage is nice,This this stores a bunch of GBs
4198,5,Incredible item!! I don’t have words or photos to describe it!!,"When I was worried the most about my identity staying protected, I experienced the worst date breach of my life! But with my Seagate passport, I was able to stay connected and meet some incredible people who saved my art! 😍"
4199,5,Great product that will last,Love this for ps5 external drive space
4200,5,Perfect,Perfect external storage for my pc
4201,5,good drive,good drive for what I needed
4202,1,Keeps malfunctioning,Second time I have to send in for repairs in less than 6 months owning it. A waste of money.
4203,5,Easy to use,Easy to setup to be used with MacBook Air.
4204,1,Dead after 3 months,"After a month or so of using this, it has now become frustrating to use. The write speed is so slow, and for some reason I have to keep taking it out and plugging it in to do anything with it since I'd constantly run into the issue of nothing working (deleting files in it, etc)UPDATE: So I bought this in September, it is now December, and now the drive is not being detected by my computer at all. I've kept it in its own case and only used it maybe once a week. I think it's better to buy a bunch of smaller drives instead of relying on one expensive one. Even if yours doesn't die in the time mine did, I can be sure that it will just have gotten worse over time."
4205,3,Doesn't work on all devices promised,It stated this device would work on a PlayStation 4. It does not
4206,1,NOT 2TB,"I ordered two of these as listed ""2TB EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE"" - I am a photographer and I needed back up for a large number of files, I opened and registered them but when I went to reformat for MAC I realized although the inner label on the box and what is listed on Amazon is not correct. I was given 2, miss-labeled 1TB External Drives. I'm keeping them because I absolutely need some of these backed up immediately but I should have a full 4TB to work with and I only have 2.I've used SEAGATE for years, and not had an issue but these are completely miss-labeled from the listing to the interior carton packaging."
4207,5,It works!,It works
4208,5,Perfect!,"This hard drive currently holds 2 computers & an iPad. It was easy to use, I love it!"
4209,5,Piece of mind photo storage,Years ago I used a cloud service and was unable to retrieve photos and documents when a computer crashed. Fortunately I use these to backup my computers and move photos and files to and from multiple laptops.
4210,2,The USB 3.1 cord connecting SD to PC came bent &,"I never got to use it. It was after the 30 day return window before I needed it, so when i went to connect the drive to my PC, I finally noticed that the card end of the USB cable was bent, and completely unusable. Plz help."
4211,3,Port failure,"I have purchased several Seagate hard drives before. They eventually fail. And it seems as if the reason they fail is because the port becomes loose or damaged. In other words, the connection is disrupted. SO the drive still works--you just can't talk to it anymore. This is frustrating. I must obtain a replacement now--yet again--because this latest drive's connection is starting to disconnect and reconnect. Must consider whether to try an SSD or keep replacing HDD every few years (while hoping the drive doesn't utterly fail before I can copy it over to the new drive). But if Seagate could make better ports...? Or if they had a way to replace just the port...? Huh, Seagate?"
4212,5,Good value,Good value for the money. Works well
4213,5,Does the job with no issues.,"Easy to use, self explanatory operation, & portable."
4214,5,Plug and play,"Just download Seagate’s software, plug this in, and it backs up all the data on your PC. After the initial back up, it backs up just the new files every day."
4215,5,Great for read only storage,"These are great storage drives.I have 5 of them, the oldest is almost 3 years old. They are fast enough for a media server, storing photo's, music, etc. Works on mac, linux and of course windows.For general purpose random writing, update, delete and read, I would try a older technology(non shingled) disk."
4216,1,stopped working,"this stopped working after 2 months. the computers stopped reading it, it just died. super lame considering it was over $50. useless."
4217,5,Easy storage,This worked great at storing our photos and was a great help at reducing the storage used on our computers
4218,5,Easy to access,Need it badly and great choice I did . Thank u
4219,4,Give plenty of room for download of games and apps a1,No complaints
4220,5,Very professional,Good product and very fast shipping
4221,5,It will get most items near it wet,Works as advertised!
4222,4,Tech Support is Almost Everything!!! You can trust Seagate!,"I'm a Seagate fan, and I purchased this drive to back up a Western Digital that died.But then, the Seagate died (it lasted longer).It was terribly disappointing to have to call support, but their support truly rivals Amazon.A gentleman from Canada offered me data recovery without blinking an eye.They sent me a case number and a free shipping label.It may take a bit to get both drives back; yes, a working bare drive with my data and a brand new Seagate Expansion drive, the same one I purchased.But it will be worth it.These drives are great drives, but a few fail and it's usually early on during the warranty.I will definitely purchase from them again. This is a company you can trust.I think these are the best drives.I have several brands of hard drives, and that's just my opnion.I gave 4 stars because 14 tbs means a bit less than that and these are the larger drives that need a power adapter so 4 stars for portability.The smaller ones are better for portabillity and I have 4 or 5 of them.They are good too.This is the first time I've ever had to call support.I couldn't believe how much assistance I got.I've owned over a dozen drives from them so that's pretty good odds.I will update this when my drives are returned.I've never bought one that is as large as this one.It worked very well until it didn't and it was very quiet until it didn't.One thing is for sure, I'll be buying from Seagate again.They back up their product.I feel like I can count on them."
4223,1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS!,DO NOT BUY! STOPS WORKING OUT OF NOWHERE!
4224,1,Fake!,This product does not work. It appears to be a fake.
4225,5,Tamaño adecuado,Capacidad de almacenamiento
4226,5,"Seagate Portable 1TB External Hard Drive HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PS4, & Xbox,","Seagate Portable 1TB External Hard Drive HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PS4, & Xbox, was exactly what I needed to back up my computer. I highly recommend this product and seller"
4227,1,MISADVERTISED,Does not work for the PS4 or Series S xbox
4228,5,External Hard drive,Easy to use. Just plug in
4229,1,"Lit up, but failed to backup","This was my third Seagate drive. The first worked well for several years then went dead. The second (a different model) is still in service on another computer after 5 years. So I was happy to buy another Seagate.But this one was a disappointment. I tried to use it to back up an older mac. It lit up, formatted and the computer said it was backing up. It was really slow and later, it displayed an error that it could not complete the backup. I assumed at the time it was that the computer I was backing up - an older model that I thought might be incompatible with the drive due to its age.I set the drive aside until I got my new iMac. Reformatted the drive and tried to back up. It appeared to initiate the back as before but again ended in the same failure message.So sadly, I found out too late that the drive was at fault, not the computer. The return window is closed. My bad.Since my older Seagate is still in service, I might try the brand one more time. But not this model."
4230,5,Plug and Play EASY!!,I loved that this just works. I will be buying again and what a great price.
4231,5,I love these little drives. Very portable with respectable storage.,"I use these drives for a number of things. I’ve got one attached to a Plex server, but one of them is used for my photography. I have a 1TB iPad Pro, but that space fills up pretty quick (not as quick as when I was shooting weddings) and I’m using it for all of my editing now. An iPad with one or two of these drives is great to work with on the road, and fits perfectly with my new workflow."
4232,5,"Easy to install, files transfer super fast. Small compact size.",My desktop was full with photos that I didn't have time to parse down so I needed a quick solution for file backup. This unit is very compact and moved my files quickly. This is my second Seagate external hard drive and I'm happy with both of them.
4233,3,Got the wrong size drive delivered,Got the wrong drive i ordered the 2 terybite drive got the one terybite otherwise works fine so far little quick to heat up but pretty decent otherwise id be satisfied with a partial refund sence I'll be keeping it but at least enough to make up for the difference of size of drives i ordered
4234,5,Perfecto,Cumple 100% con su objetivo
4235,5,Perfect size,It’s nice and compact. With a big capacity.
4236,5,easy to use,storage of data. as intended.
4237,5,very good,very good
4238,5,todo es seguro,Es muy rápido
4239,5,Good Value.,Nice Product.
4240,2,do not get this if you have a Mac,this product is described as being compatible with Mac and Windows - it's NOT. not unless you jumpthrough a lot of hoops to make it work . ALL of their software is only windows compatible. total waste of money if you have a Mac - way too many hoops.VERY MISLEADING to say it is compatible with both.
4241,5,It's the best solution for a laptop if you need more space,I needed this more downloading more games onto my laptop it's the best.
4242,1,No good after 2 months,"Do not buy!! I used this product for extra storage for my Xbox and it stopped working after 2 months of using it, no good for the price"
4243,5,Small in physical size. Large in storage,My last external hard drive fried. Hope this one does not
4244,5,Great drive does everything you need,Great for exfat cross platform storage.
4245,5,Works great.,Good for needs at our home. I recommend.
4246,5,Small But Large Capacity,Using it as a backup for our Mac. Works seamlessly and is faster than the other one I have used.
4247,5,"It does what it’s supposed to do, so a five star for me.","Nothing, works great."
4248,5,Great external drive,Super easy to set up and use.
4249,5,Speed of the back up,"I feel the education of how to use the product can be immensely improved, such as vidios."
4250,5,EXCELENT Ítem,"Sagateate that you have not paid me anything sadly for this comment, in fact, a refund would not be a bad idea lol.The Sagateate Barracuda are in my experience the best HDDs, the ones that better handle temperature.This external Disk as long as I take care of it as God intended.no shocks, no electrical cuts or movements while the PC uses it, it will last you externally.I have been using a 1TB for more than 11 years, and it is new, in super excellent condition.I hope this reviews serve you.You know as long as you use it properly it will last forever.Regarding the speed 125 to 135 megabytes per second.The right thing to do while copying large files.in files such as documents and photography will vary, it is normal"
4251,5,So far So good,Had this product for over 2 weeks now and downloaded so many games onto this drive. Everything works and have no complaints so far!
4252,5,Drives inside are exos enterprise drives,"Drives inside are exos enterprise drives, which sell for ~$100 more as a bare drive than in these units.Also, the drive inside this unit has a sata adapter so you can just take it out of the enclosure and install it in your PC as a standard drive, which is what I have done with 2 of these units."
4253,4,If you have write speeds at 2mbps and often times out. It may be the Amazonbasic wire,"I faced an issue where I was getting write speeds at 2mbps and having my connection dropped every time. I thought, like the other reviews it was because of the harddrive. But i switched to the wire that it came with and magically my write speeds were 60 mbps+ and no drops. The issue was the Amazon Basic wire advertised with this drive."
4254,5,Great product!!,"This portable is awesome!! I ordered it and it arrives the very next day!! It freed up so much space, my playstation 4 was back to normal. The price was perfect as well."
4255,5,It does what it's supposed to do.,Works exactly the way my old one does. Worth every penny.
4256,2,Lasted 1 1/2 years,"This was a great external hard drive - until it stopped working. There was no warning and suddenly nothing can be retrieved. Luckily I back up current (work) things on other devices, but I've lost a lot of personal files I will really miss. It worked well, but only until it quit with no warning."
4257,5,Great Product,Easy to use - perfecter my needs
4258,5,Perfect,Just what I wanted. Great price too
4259,5,Works perfect,I use this to expand the storage on my Xbox one I've had it for a little over two months zero issues.
4260,5,Genial!,"Hasta ahora el disco excelente, llego antes de lo esperado, tiene buena tasa de transferencia de archivos y el disco es muy liviano; muy practico en mi opinión."
4261,5,😀,"Happy to have found this very reasonably priced, very large capacity drive."
4262,5,My data point,Great product
4263,5,Seagate fan!,Can always count on Seagate. Liked so much ordered another!
4264,5,Works perfect with my PS4,"I bought it because my PS4 was already full ( memory space ) and and I had to be erasing games constantly. No more! This is the solution I needed and it works great, just plug ( format ) and play."
4265,3,Not a very good backup / clone / image drive,I’m getting 25meg write on this and it took 8 hours to back up a 1tb ssd.
4266,4,Gamer Approved!,"Got this to be able to have more computer games as well as store my wives books and photos on. Have 4 games on it, her pictures, and 4 of her books (that she's writing) and still a ton of space left."
4267,5,Awesome External Drive!,"The Seagate external drive 8TB, it arrived early, well packaged, the delivery driver made sure it was in my hands & didnt just drop it off, it was easy to set up (plug and play), i have several drives in my computer and still simple to identify.It holds 7.29 TB out of the 8TB you get, very fast download speed, secure. I dont game on a console so i dont know, but deff. does FPS games well on PC....I have nothing but good to say about SEAGATE....."
4268,1,Worked long enough to load photos. Now can't get it to be recognized on three computers.,"I bought the hard drive late last November and loaded some photos on it over a few days.It never worked again.I have tried to get it to function on three different computers (Apple and PC).Now I find out that even though I bought it in November of 2020, the warranty ended in September.10 month warranty?$58 out the window."
4269,5,You will never run out of room,I use this for my ps5 and I don't think I will have to worry about space again
4270,1,Terrible writing speeds. Can't get it above 18-19 MB/s,What is the point of a high capacity drive if it takes forever to write anything to it?
4271,1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware from these scammer sellers, bought a 2TB HARD DRIVE, was out of warranty so I decided to open it thinking bad controller only to find it’s a 160GB HDD. Check storage Immediately for any buyers in the future"
4272,3,It's slow,"Small, quite portable.Write speeds are slow. It advertises 120MB/s. I am seeing around half of that for large sequential transfers.Took most of a day to copy 2tb to it"
4273,1,WiFi problems,"Whenever I would plug it into my computer it would block my WiFi from working, and now my computer takes like 10 minutes to even connect to the internet. Customer support won’t get back to me!"
4274,5,Great Drive!,Fast drive and easy to use.
4275,1,Strange,"Sent twice, never made to me.Good side refound was issued"
4276,5,Good storage,I have a ps4 and only had one game on it because the storage was full already and man idk why it has so many bad reviews. It works perfectly fine with me. I have 3 games now lol I give it a 10/10
4277,5,Great,Exactly what you’d be looking for to store more games.
4278,5,Easy to set up,Plug and play. Easy.
4279,5,Xbox One S,Bought this item for my sons Xbox one S.Had product for about 3 months now with no issues.Son was able to move his games to device.Did not need tech support.
4280,1,Drive failed,This drive failed a month after getting it with 2TB of important data.
4281,2,"USB 3 is flimsy, not log lasting; SUCKS.","This is the second one I purchased in Jan of this year and man, what a waste of money. It's been on my desk for most of the time but now just randomly unplugs itself. I restart and an hour or a week later it'll just fritz out again. What a drag."
4282,5,Easy yo use.,Meets my needs
4283,1,This hard drive stopped working after about 2 months,"I was very disappointed because this product let me down very early. Tech Support is giving me the option to send it back for data recovery but i was informed that my files may or may not be able to be recovered. Although, I will say they were kind & professional on the phone."
4284,5,Great!,Just what I needed to back up my movies.
4285,4,Plug and play,"Originally bought the external hard drive for my ps4 to give it more storage. It was super easy to install just plug in the connections, go to your settings, and allow it to be the main storage. When I was finally able to get my hands on the PS5 the whole ssd update hadn’t come out yet so I just transferred the external drive to my PS5 the same way and boom an extra 2TB. No complaints and it’s definitely worth the price."
4286,5,Great Portable Hard Drive,Great product easy to use.
4287,5,Best external drive I've ever owned highly recommend,"Fast, easy, reliable, small.Replaced a prior Seagate external cloud.Was impossible to get a backup on the old one.Always was stuck and missed allot.Opened this one, plugged in the USB and was done with my 1st backup of fairly large drive in about 35 minutes.Only missed files were some minor files protected by my companies IS/IT team.Next time I'll log in as full administrator and it won't skip a beat.Highly recommend for anyone.Now I can get back to backing up every month by turning on and walking away for under an hour."
4288,5,Best Purchase Yet!,"My old portable hard drive bit the dust, and hubster suggested Seagate. It came and it was so easy to use. I say that because I can be a bit techno-challenged. This little hard drive works!"
4289,1,Be prepared to give up personal information,"So... this is not just a plug and play... this will ask you to register with Seagate and potentially sign up for Adobe programs (which in my experience charge a month fee for that privilege) This was an expensive lesson in 'NOT WHAT I WANTED' and I have had several external hard drives that never ask for registration and agreement to accept cookies and access to your ip address, personal information etc."
4290,2,A pain to use,"Originally purchased for my Xbox One. I downloaded too many games and needed extra storage. Several weeks later I purchased one specifically branded for Xbox and decided to use this as backup storage for my laptop. I saved some documents on this external drive just in case.Well over a year later I decided to upgrade my laptop to a PC. It'sbrand new computer, I plug this external drive into my PC and it's giving me the run around. I use to be able to just plug it in and go, it doesn't show up on my windows explorer. I had to google the info, run a bunch of command prompts and do all this hoopla just to get it to show up on my windows explorer. I'm seriously irritated and even had to format this thing just to get it to work.To make matters worse, why does my computer say the storage space is 1.81 when it's advertised as 2? What a ripoff. If this was within the return period I would've returned it."
4291,5,It's small and holds alot,My daughter use it for her game and she luv it
4292,5,Great purchase!,"Definitely glad I purchased this. Lightweight, durable, easy set up, compact size."
4293,5,Nice Little Hard Drive,I used this to back up my desktop hard drive. It handled the task well. I also use it with a laptop. USB 2.0
4294,5,Great buy,Excellent purchase
4295,1,Sticky substance leaking around the bottom edge,"Bought this 2.5 months ago as external HDD for for my son's Xbox console. He recently noticed a sticky substance coming out all around the bottom edge but this external drive is in an ambient room temperature of 72-74 degrees F, and my son only plays on his Xbox during weekends."
4296,5,It was easy to hook up and it works,"Got it for my 9 yr. old grandson's PS4. He's happy, so I'm happy."
4297,5,Easy to set up and great results,I love the extra storage
4298,4,Seagate/LaCie getting less and less plug and play on a Mac,"I have purchase a Seagate large capacity external drive (18TG) and a LaCielarge capacity external drive (16TB) and have had issues with the drives taking a long time to mount(5 minutes or more). Others have experienced this problem and have suggested several solutions. None of these solutions worked for me and merely seem to be a way of passing the time until the drives finally decide to mount.I discovered the root problem when I purchased my last Seagate drove (8TB). Such drives have been fine in the past with no mounting issues or other issues. They were plug and play. However, this latest drive was plug and play but not plug and write. I could not get the drive out of read only mode. Finally after chtting with Seagate technical support I found out I had to reformat the drive to Mac Extended (Journaled) and GUD Partition Map. Now the drive works fine. I went back and reformatted the other drives thusly and now they all mount quickly and work just fine.It seems that as time goes by, Seagate and LaCie drives (companies seem to be connected) are less and less Mac OS compatible. My suggestion is that if you purchase drives from these companies you save the content they come with and immediately reformat them to the Mac Extended format, then restore the goodies they came with. Do not believe the plug and play hype that is advertised."
4299,1,Waste of money,This product is a waste of money and only lasted two months and crapped out
4300,5,Storage,Works great if plug all cords in all way
4301,5,Great,It works fine. Does what it’s supposed to do.
4302,5,Good for the price,Very reasonable price and works great with my Xbox One
4303,5,Great for Photo Storage,"This portable hard drive fit my needs - a great external drive to hold my pictures.Easy to store, plenty of space, great product!"
4304,4,Works perfect for PS4 and PS5,I got this in order to transfer games from my PS4 to my PS5 and it worked exactly as expected. This hard drive is very affordable and does exactly what i needed it to.
4305,5,Connecting to ps4 pro was a breeze,Great storage capacity
4306,1,This does not work with your PS4 as I thought it did,"As I stated. Thought I got a good deal for a hard drive for my ps4. Suppose to plug and go. Is not found at all with my PS4. So, wasted money for me"
4307,5,Excellent Value - good performance,Added this product to iMac as Time Machine backup. Working great so far.
4308,5,Would recommend,"For the price it is and how much storage you get, it’s a must buy!"
4309,5,Nice product,"I use in my ps4 and this is fantastic, i have some games in the external disk."
4310,1,Broken after a few uses. Beeps and lost all files.,"Do not purchase this product. After having used this product for less than a year (because when I initially configured it to work with my Mac, the files would slow down my Adobe Premiere Pro software), I plugged it in and it started making a loud beeping sound and all my files are now lost as the device no longer appears on my computer, or any other devices. I tried plugging it into a power source, different computer, different cord, nothing works. Horrible product."
4311,4,Good product,"Good product, transportable, but very delicate"
4312,5,Works fine,It might be a little slow to transfer files but gets the job done and great value for the price
4313,3,Failed after one year,"I have used this drive as a PC backup drive for about one year and it has started to go bad; SMART disk data reports that there are 24 bad sectors on the drive, which indicates a physical problem of some sort. I first noticed this problem when my PC would fail to back up time and time again.To my knowledge I have done nothing to damage the drive myself but I won't pretend that it is impossible.I've given it three stars because, up until this point, it has functioned flawlessly; I am just very disappointed that it did not last longer than this."
4314,5,This was a gift,The recipient is happy with the Seagate.
4315,5,Works with X Box One,
4316,5,I forgot what having and external is like.,Even on my 3.0 USB connection this is remarkably slow compared to my HD/SSD internal arrangement.I didn't buy for speed though and it transfers fine.
4317,5,Ps4 compatible,I'm using this to upgrade my ps4 memory. It has worked perfectly without any issue whatsoever.
4318,5,Must get,This is a very good item im happy i got this one
4319,5,Good deal!,Good deal!
4320,5,Very Compact,Very compact and easily transported.
4321,5,Game space,Best price to save games and music. It's worth it.
4322,5,Wonderful for VoD storage,Bought this because I was tired of VoDs and schoolwork cluttering my PC storage and slowing things down. This beauty works like a charm and is quick to load.
4323,1,Data lost,"Months of work data lost!Over a year of university data lost!Uni assignments and feedback, and pdfs from professors lost two days before one of my exams. Do not trust this product!"
4324,5,Great!,I have had my seagate for over 4 years now and it runs amazing!
4325,5,Need for my Xbox one storage,Helped me keep all my game data and helped meclean up my console
4326,4,Only have 1.8T,"The hard drive looks pretty and runs fast, but it miss 200G......"
4327,5,Good,"It does what it says it does. Others have noted that it can be very slow with USB 2.0, but it seems to be a lot faster with USB 3.0, at least for me. I got 2 TB and it is extremely big and I haven't even used half a terabyte yet. I greatly underestimated how big a terabyte is. Anyway good product, no issues."
4328,5,Worth buying,We bought this for my sons PS4 and we’ve already downloaded so many games for him. He now had a lot of games to choose from.
4329,5,"Big, Fast and Portable. Perfect",Very easy to plug and load. Downloaded a Backup program and all worked perfectly
4330,2,Just bought another one...because the first one isn't working,I originally bought one of these Sept 2019. Its already gone out - trying another one because they're cheap
4331,5,Just what i expected...,Just what i expected works great.
4332,5,great hard drive,Great for copying music from my old pc to the seagate.
4333,2,"I tried removing it for the first time then, it doesn't load on both my PC and ps5.","The media could not be loaded. I very much like seagate, I've used a similar one in the past.... But this is getting on my nerves lol"
4334,5,Very good,Good price for the small portable hard drive.
4335,5,Stopped my son from complaining about the space on his computer!!!!,My son's gaming PC.
4336,1,was great storage to it stoped working,I had it for 9 months and it worked great but now computer does not see it and it stopped working but it still lights up as if it was on
4337,1,DO NOT BUY LOST EVERYTHING IN LESS THAN A MONTH,I didn’t have this external hard drive a full month when it started beeping and didn’t connect. I lost a lot of files due to this! Very disappointed and will never buy anything from this company again!
4338,3,UwU,UwU didnt work for what I needed
4339,5,perfect portable storage,Perfect portable storage for audio recording
4340,5,Great performance.Heck of a value.,"I can't believe how well this works for the money.I'm getting 130MB, sustained, both ways from this drive."
4341,5,Big,Love it this replaces my TB
4342,4,Love it!,We love this brand! We use them for backups at work to archive. They work awesome!
4343,5,thanks,Storage Capacity is good with good quality. thanks
4344,5,Great piece of hardware,"The product is a nice comfortable compact size, doesn't weight too much and is easily transportable. It has an ample amount of storage you can fit a multitude of games and still have enough storage. The only draw back I would say is not being able to unplug it when you're moving your console but other than that works awesome and does its purpose"
4345,5,Excelente inversión,Práctico
4346,5,Quality product,High amount of storage.Fast read-write.
4347,5,Super easy to use ps4,"In no way am I good at technology related things. I plugged this in to my ps4, I was able to navigate and get it set up for extra storage on my ps4 so easily. Definitely recommend"
4348,4,chriping,it's ok
4349,5,Seagate has been my favorite drive since the 80's,"I used to be in computer sales eons ago and when we replace those old IBM computers and IBM compatibles, I've always used seagate.They were reliable.30 years later, western digital became the forefront of drives and one day, it just died and I lost everything.Every since then, I've been buying seagate and haven't lost a file.knock on wood."
4350,1,Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive HDD doesn't work on xbox one,"I payed $165.99 for this device and even though they advertised that it worked on Xbox one, it didn't.they then charged me $83.00 as a restocking fee."
4351,5,Downloaded maaad games on my Xbox!!!!!!,"Works pretty well and thankfully, I haven’t had any problems with this hard drive after owning it for about 3 months now. I downloaded a ton of games on my xbox all of which are at least 100 gbs like cod warzone and Cold War and i still have like 2 tbs of space left lmao. Definitely worth the purchase bruhs!"
4352,1,Garbage,"I used this garbage about 5 or 6 times. Placed on it everything I have. My computer stopped “seeing it”, it does not show up anymore. I can nit access my stuff. Regret buying it"
4353,1,After a few months it is already failing,Bought the 5 terabyte storage for my ps5 and a few months it it’s having problems. Every now and then I have to “repair” it on my ps5 to get it to work. It also sometimes disconnects on its on which is insane since I’ve never moved/unplugged it. I had high hopes but now I wish I hadn’t put any faith into it since it gives out so often
4354,5,No problems,Works great.For apple users it does have to be set up for it.
4355,1,Junk,Never could get it to work so wasted money
4356,1,Burned out in 6 months,"Seagate drives are not built as they used to be. They are not reliable long term, this drive barley lasted 6 months before not functioning anymore, compared to my Western Digital drives that have lasted much longer and continue to work. This is apparently a trend with Seagate now. Don't waste your money"
4357,5,Great device keeps my game from messing up,Works perfectly as it should
4358,5,It's good,"Good quality plastic shell, compact and light with a decent read/write speed.Not expensive and 2Tb is more than enough for what I needed it for.If I had any complaint it would be that the included cable is on the short side and stiff, but that pretty much goes for all external drives now days."
4359,5,Dependable portable storage,Large storage capacity and good upload/download times.It has not failed me and I have over a TB used on this drive.I would buy Seagate products again.Haven't had to use product support as it was fairly simple to set up and have had no problems.Pleased.
4360,1,"Died, Replacement Died","I've bought Seagate drives for years. However, my experience with their portable drive was most disappointing. In June, I ordered a 2 TB Portable Drive. It failed to write in three months. I called Seagate, which sent a replacement. It died in a day. On my Mac, I ran First Aid without luck. I was unable to reformat the drive as well. Seagate only offered yet another drive. I decided to recycle it. I'm going to buy something else."
4361,1,Failed 1 Year Never Dropped. Could NOT rescue data.,"Changed rating after 1 Year. Return window expired. Lost all data, Hardware failure, Could NOT be rescued by an IT geek. garbage . sorry. I live in LongmontCO where a SEAGATE location / hub is, ashamed.."
4362,4,Device,The media could not be loaded. It’s good idk why it just stop working for me .My brotherhad it for a year nowbut all of sudden it doesn’t work on me. I play on Xbox one has about 6 games in there plus Netflix and all but it’s kinda weird how it stopped working. Does anybody know what’s wrongOr does the company know ???!!
4363,5,Perfect for ps5,Works perfectly!
4364,5,Good hard drive for ps4,Very good for PS4
4365,5,Works great,It’s a great product
4366,5,Un buen producto,Tengo más del año con este disco duro portátil y me a salido muy bien ya que tengo instalados algunos videojuegos y goza de un buen estado de salud
4367,5,Great device,Great storage device.This my second one.The first one I’ve had for years. Great for the money.
4368,5,very fast and easy to use,Has been very fast and dependable
4369,2,Dead after 16 months,"This is a hard drive with the shortest life I ever bought. I'm buying hard drives since 1998 and this hard drive has been connected to my iMac as a backup drive. Started to get error messages from Time Machine and after a number of new backup retries I was still getting backup errors so I restarted the computer and now the hard drive not showing at all. I tried changing the cable, and connect it to my laptop but no sign of life (the light is on). Warranty? - out, Only one year. I paid $135. - too expensive for such a short life."
4370,3,Decent for the price but fragile,These drives are not as sturdy as the old Seagates were. It was bumped during initial transfer and the drive became unworkable requiring a replacement. Keep it cushioned at all times
4371,1,The worst product I have ever purchased,"It is so broken in exact one year right before I was about to backup my work data. I had been using it very carefully, but it was suddenly not working. I sent it to several data recovery companies but they could not fix it. Basically I lost all the data I created in the past year. It is so disappointing!"
4372,5,Formated - exFAT,"My drive came formatted exFAT which allows my Mac and Pc to read and write files.I was searching comments and could not find a direct answer on this.You can google and the ups and downs of exFAT, but its the format you want if you are using the drive with a Mac and Windows OS to both read and write files"
4373,4,Good product.,Good product.
4374,2,Horribly slow,"This drive is heaven extremely spacious and portable, but my god is it slow. I was impressed when I first received it, but after 8 hours of trying to back up 350 GB I wish I had bought something else."
4375,1,Save your money,"Stopped working and died after 6-8 weeks, and return window for return closed 😡"
4376,5,Good product,Still use it best product and good price...👍🏿
4377,5,"Great product, Fast delivery","Great product, Fast delivery"
4378,1,No support whatsoever/drive lasts about 6 months.,"Drive lasted from April to October. Complete failure. Was using for xbox and I never disconnected it. Just one morning turned on the system and the drive no longer was able to be read. Hmm, only 6 months of use and only 25% capacity used. Tried to contact Seagate to get my drive replaced while it's still under warranty.Digital agents are slow to respond, if they respond at all. I've had three attempts where I respond to chat and no response happens over 10 minutes. The bots that just walk you through a troubleshoot menu when you first connect are not even helpful, and when you call the number listed on the site, it gives you three ads, if you decline them, they just hang up on you before you can reach a representative. The warrant/rescue service is not real from what I have spent hours trying to get help with it. I would never recommend buying one of these unless you want a disposable drive that works for a month or so."
4379,5,It was worth it,It works very well I highly recommend
4380,1,Second one died faster than the first I purchased...,"This was my second Seagate purchase.The first one lasted a few months and then got really hot, started making chirping noises and died on me.This second one started the chirping noises immediately.It ran a backup, but got really hot while it was running and then shut down without being ejected properly.Needless to say, I'm disappointed.Normally this would be a brand I'd trust and recommend."
4381,5,Works,It was good
4382,5,Will buy again have purchased this twice already,Product works great just format on the gaming system and its ready to go.
4383,5,Good for any computer or game system.,"I always loved Seagate's selection of External Harddrives, I use to own a few of their Harddrives for my xbox one, ps4 etc. I bought this one for my Nintendo Wii U. Very happy with the amount of memory, and i'm always pleased with Seagate."
4384,5,Perfect for storage,"Plenty of storage for docs, pics and music."
4385,2,This Did not work for my MacBook Pro but...,"It says there's a way for it to install on MacBook Pro but wow this was very difficult for me to work with, plus you gotta sign up for registration on it and to me that was very unnecessary! I had bought a flash drive that worked better for me! The THKAILAR is The Best Flash Drive to use! I'm glad I Bought Both of them at the same time and I find it's Easy to have The THKAILAR USB C Flash Drive Better! But this Seagate Might Better for a Regular Windows PC user but I'm telling you, it just won't work for my MacBook Pro and I Have a 2020 MacBook Pro."
4386,5,Slow Downloads- AMAZING product.,"after downloading 1 or two games the download speed would drop to be super long, like a day or two but as long as you’re only trying to do 1 thing at a time then it works like magic. after downloading about $300 worth of games there is still 1.87TB left, definitely a good lifetime purchase!"
4387,5,The best external hard drive ever,"This is my second External Hard Drive from Seagate. The first I got many years ago, never let me down, works very well until now. I needed more space available in my computer, that's the reason for buying another one. Seagate is a good choice always."
4388,1,NOT compatible with ps4,I bought this product because the reviews said it could be used as extra storage for PlayStation 4. When I tried to use it for that right out of the box it said it could not be formatted properly and couldn’t be used with the ps4.
4389,5,Great for the xbox,"I got this for my xbox and it work very well, it's pretty cheap for a 4tb. Love this product you should get for your consoles."
4390,1,The worst external drive.. always fails to be mounted and lost all my data several time,The worst external drive.. always fails to be mounted and lost all my data several time
4391,5,Works for my Xbox,I finally got more storage for my Xbox and it works really well.
4392,1,Does NOT work for Mac,"As others have mentioned, this does NOT work with Mac."
4393,5,Good hdd for ps4,Very good hard drive for PS4
4394,5,It’s perfect,"I’ve been using this since April, 2020, and it’s been working fine. I feel content and haven’t had any issues."
4395,1,Seagate fails again with Mac -- don't consider buying this. Zero stars would be better.,They say it works with Mac. And it did... for two weeks. Now I'm overseas so I can't return it.Infuriating. I should never have purchased.Neither should you.
4396,5,Works great,"I do alot of photography at a non profit Zoo I volunteer with, I take hundreds of photos a week so this helps free up space on my computer, and is one of the backups I use now after having another laptop crash and take all my photos with it."
4397,5,Your search is over!,"This usb SD card reader works great!I like that because of the design, it fits in all my work computer towers. As soon as I plug it in, the SD card viewer pops up on my screen so I can edit photos. I’m a yearbook advisor and use this device daily. I highly recommend it!"
4398,1,"If you are purchasing for Xbox One, Series X or Series - DON'T","It appears that Microsoft has done some sort of update for the XBox that makes it where it will not recognize a lot of the external hard drives.My daughter's stopped recognizing her Seagate drive abruptly after flawless use for over a year.I assumed it had gone bad and bought another one like it.The console would not recognize it either.On a whim, I purchased the Seagate one that has the ""Halo"" person on it - it's the ""official"" Xbox drive.The console saw it immediately.Clearly it's something they have done in an upgrade somehow but just know that if you are having difficulties with the console seeing the external HDD, don't buy this one because it won't see it either."
4399,5,Ease of purchase,To store more photos. Very happy with this product
4400,5,Good Price/Quality/Function,"It's nice and quick for most needs, has a very high capacity, and both the drive and cables are of high quality. Regardless of what storage needs you may have this drive is an excellent addition to any external storage collection."
4401,4,Good built quality,I bought it 2 weeks ago and it met my expectation. Writing speed is a bit slow but acceptable. It is better if we have an On/Off power button.
4402,5,Perfect,Great size and storage capacity.
4403,1,Doesn't save Anything,"Every time i try to savemy progress on my PlayStation 5 . it says i have to ""restore"".. Then Doesn't save ANYTHING"
4404,5,Great portable hard drive,I really like that you can just plug it into a USB port to use. No more trying to find an outlet. Makes it easy to take with you to work or a friends house.
4405,5,Best and most reliable for the money!,"I used it for a time machine backup drive for my main computer, I had a 3.2 TB to back up… this drive easily handled the job. The instructions as to how to use it as a Time Machine were very clear and the entire experience was a pleasant one. Highly recommend Seagate drives."
4406,4,Pretty perfect EXCEPT for noise.,"Exactly what I wanted for backing up lots and lots of video files.Very fast transfer, so not much waiting.Only minor quibble is the noise.It's a LOUD drive, and can be distracting, particularly when you're editing a video clip.But that's minor, price and performance is fine."
4407,5,Solid external hard drive,"This is the second time I bought this external hard drive because I liked the first one so much but needed a second! The drive is relatively small, highly portable, and works well! 2TB of space is pretty great! Would recommend!"
4408,5,works on ps4,was super easy to set up it's just missing 20 GB but I think that's normal?
4409,5,Perfect for PS4,"I’ve been using this as an external hard drive for my PS4 and it works like a charm. Very easy and simple to format for use with the PS4 (you can do it right from the system itself!) and it works flawlessly to play games on. Even when the PS4 gets shut off unexpectedly, this hard drive reboots with no issues. Device is super slim and fits right in on top of PS4 like they were meant to be together!"
4410,4,Does the job!,"Does everything it should, just take about 50 mins to download a full call of duty game."
4411,2,Seems cheap compared to earlier drives,"Compared to previous 2TB drives I have received from Seagate, this one seems to be very cheap.Made with flimsy plastic and not very sturdy or durable.I have several 2TB Seagate drives order years ago and they were in tough cases made of much more durable components.Not sure if I'll keep it, but if I do, I'll update on how well it lasts."
4412,5,Great quality!,This is a company that always provides what you need and then backs it up with support if you need to know how to use it! Have never had a problem when buying anything from this company. this company may give you a better price with the same quality you are looking for....Many sizes to choose from.
4413,4,Works,works just fine
4414,2,Not a fan. 3/4 of the time when I plug them in it takes 5+ minutes for it to show up on my desktop.,"This drive has so far been very unreliable. I don't trust it. I've had it for 2.5 months and half the time when it's plugged in, it doesn't show up on my desktop. As a photographer, I need my drives to be reliable and durable and this doesn't seem to fit the bill."
4415,5,What I like abt it,It was quite easy to set up and works like a charm if I didn’t buy this I probably would have no storage on my ps5 today
4416,5,I have and older smaller capacity Seagate and Amazon instantly delivered my upgrade.,Seagate stood up to its representation and works perfectly.
4417,5,"Amazing Value, Buy a Case","This is the best valued portable hard drive you can get. 2 TB is more than enough for the average consumer. However, I would highly recommend purchasing a case or box to put this in, as ALL portable Hard Drives are not as sturdy as Solid State Drives, due to the way storage is written on hard drives (Spinning Magnetic Discs suspended nanometers away from a writing device)."
4418,5,Use for central storage,Use for central storage. Works well and fast with usb 3 hubs.
4419,4,"Easy to use, compact, good service.",Used as external hard drive.
4420,1,Didn't work on any of my computers,"First one spun up once, then wouldn't work on any of my computers - Mac and PC. Ordered a second one, and it never worked on Mac or PC."
4421,2,Stopped working in the middle of a project for a client,"I purchased this so I could back up my video and photo files and operate off of an external hard drive rather than house large amounts of data on my computer.This failed on me in the middle of a project due for a client. I have to start over from scratch, luckily I have the raw files saved on the camera. Will have to do 8 hours of work in 2 hours."
4422,5,Amazing,Plugged this thing up to my PS4 and it instantly connected. Very easy setup and lots of storage for a good price.
4423,5,Works perfectly!,I feel more comfortable knowing that my files are backup locally on my Seagate external hard drive in addition to my cloud storage.
4424,5,"Small, Compact and priced right!",I have been waiting for quite some time to get any external HD for my LapTop.This one is paid for and a heck of a lot cheaper than Carbonite.
4425,1,I need to contact,It is arriving doesn’t work.I need to solve it as it arrives not worked I asked for return but I traveled emergency out of state and loss it’s return date
4426,5,Wow this is incredible.,"I didnt think this would work with my acer nitro 5 gaming laptop, and i was so wrong, its amazing, i plugged it into my usb, and now i got over 9 games, 341gb of space, with 400gb+ to go, thank you for making this amazing product, its literally plug and play!"
4427,1,You’ll regret buying this,See I thought this was gonna be super easy just plug in and download some games but this drive is so slow that for newer games like r6 siege and others my Xbox popped up with a message saying that this game can be played on this drive because it’s too slow. I wish there was a review like this one out there so just stay away from this one
4428,5,Wonderful!,So glad I got this! Holds all my photos and documents! Used this when I was switching from one laptop to another! It was great!!!
4429,1,Bad,"Worked well for about three months or so, until it just stopped working. Tech support wasn't much help either. Not worth it"
4430,5,Great hard drive,Plugged right in and it worked just fine. Very happy. Very fast shipping. I do recommend this seller.
4431,4,seems fine,Came early. seems to work fine.
4432,5,This is a Good deal,Got it quick and easy to use best gift for a gamer that need Little more storage
4433,5,Storage and Size,I purchased this for my PS4. I was tired of not having enough space. So far do good. Real easy to set up and it doesn't take up a lot of space. Highly recommend this if you have the same problem.
4434,5,Good product,"Good product that arrived very fast, I recommend on it to everyone"
4435,5,Does what it says,Have had this for over 6 months and downloaded multiple games (including heavy game likes WoW and Guild Wars). No issues! Super easy to install and use
4436,5,The best,Best storage I like it it works good fast download upload.
4437,4,Okay,Not too fast
4438,5,Fast video transfer,I was using this to transfer video files between locations. It handles large MP4 files fairly well and I can transfer a 10 GB video onto this drive in a few minutes.
4439,5,Does exactly what I needed it for,I've had it for over a week and while I haven't run any video editing programs on it but I have installed a few games and programs on it and so far it meets my expectations.
4440,1,Returned and received the same broken product,"I returned the hard drive because the HDMI port was bent (metal casing).I returned the product and asked for a replacement.I received the replacement hard drive and to my surprise, not only was the product bent but it was bent in the exact same place.It is quite possible that they sent the exact same item back to me but will give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was one of many that were damaged during the manufacturing process.Either way, the QC process requires improvement."
4441,1,"Failed with an IO error on first backup, filesystem rendered useless.","I purchased this a couple of weeks ago. When I plugged it into my PC to back things up from another HDD using rsync, the filesystem on this device ended up in an unrecoverable state.The rsync process got stuck in an IO system call, ended up in Uninterruptable Sleep mode (`D`). I rebooted the machine. Plugged the Seagate drive back again, the NTFS file system was corrupted.I will need to reformat it to `ext4` and try again. If you use this HDD with Linux and rsync, I would suggest you reformat it first, as soon as it arrives."
4442,5,Portable storage,So far so good easy to set up with MacBook Pro. Great storage capacity.
4443,1,Not Realiable; Risky Buy,"The first hard drive I received was dead straight out of the box. The replacement I received worked, but isn't consistently recognized by my computer. I set it up as an automatic backup drive, so the fact that it doesn't always mount when I restart my computer is a huge red flag. Do not waste your time, money & data.4-Month Update: Returning the second drive (which now refuses to mount and makes a noise when it is unplugged) to Seagate for a replacement drive. They are forcing me to pay postage on their defective drive. DO NOT BUT SEAGATE DRIVES. EVER."
4444,5,Easy to work and portable,I like the price and storage
4445,5,The Price Is Right!,"I needed an external hard drive for my music and videos and this one fits the bill. The storage capacity is more than enough to hold everything I needed. The price was reasonable and the size of the hard drive itself made it easy to transport it from one place to another. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4446,5,Works perfect,"I really wanted the 5TB but it wasn't available. I bought this for my PS4 that only has 500gb of storage. Arrived fast, and I was shocked at how small it is. Last time I bought an external HDD (500gb) was 10 years ago and it was as big a hard back Harry Potter book. Anyway, I plugged it into my PS4 and set up was a breeze. I can now re-download all my games that I have to delete any time I get something new, making it easier to access them if I feel like playing an old game. Great purchase."
4447,5,Does it's job,"I got this for extra storage on a ps4. Does it's job, can't complain. I have no idea what it's speed are like connected to a pc but I can't imagine it's that fast."
4448,1,Died after 6 months. Requires replacement. Not sure if warranty will cover.,"It was working fine with zero complaints until a few months in, when it just stopped writing backups entirely. Went through multiple rounds of tech support trying to fix the issue and nothing worked. We'll see if this warranty replaces it or not. Either way, not sure I even want a replacement if that's just going to die in a few months too."
4449,5,Very good,100%
4450,5,Works great as my iMac backup drive.,Just works.
4451,5,Uso interno o externo,"Muy buena inversión, puedes retirar el disco del case y utilizarlo como unidad interna Ya que trae puertos sata convencionales, de hecho lo utilice para una torre mini itx que estaba ensamblando para jugar"
4452,5,Excelente calidad precio valor,"Excelente disco duro , lo uso como copia de respaldo en una macbook , funciona hasta ahora muy bien"
4453,3,Save your money.,"It was affordable for a reason. Lasted me awhile for sure but awhile isn't good enough if it's an integral part of your system. And it didn't just quit on me. It made a whole 6 month long event about it where I'd have to find ways of appealing its whims because my charge cable for my controller had the nerve to slightly brush the cord the drive came with. Then there's the wonderful times where it would be connected and just decide that nah its not and I'm seeing things. I need to just unplug it and restart the console and hope it decides to work and need repair because it wasn't disconnected properly. Which every time I had to do that I was gambling since it could very well corrupt every file on there. I did that a lot. I'm not sure what I did to upset it enough to finally give up entirely but I'll be honest, we're both in a better place for it. I leave with more patience and gray hairs, but at least it's done.Don't buy this jank garbage. Just get a more reliable one that costs more. In the end, it really doesn't."
4454,5,No problems!,Got this for my son. He's had no problems so I assume it's a good product.Lol
4455,1,DO NOT BUY,I Was excited that I finally got another Storage for my Xbox one well it started to do well I managed to download all my big games but after a month my Xbox was not detecting my hard drive what so ever I did everything people said from restarting my xbox to a full rest andnothing and then I tried to connect it with my pc that didn’t work either at the end I came to the realization that I have a dead drive and it only lasted me a month.
4456,5,Very easy to set up! 5/5,Easy to connect and access.
4457,4,"Rugged, easy and reliable","ProsWithstands the (involuntary) 2 ft fall testAdequate physical size to carry around (or flee from a disaster area)Manufacturer's technical support and test softwareGood warrantyConsBundled backup and restore program runs only full backups, not incremental or differential onesComputer hiccups, hardware failures, disasters or viruses? When they hit, it may be too late to rescue your precious files and digital photos. That's why I believe in backups, and the reason why acquired the Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 when I had a fair amount of reward points accumulated somewhere.This is the second brand name external HDD that I've used of more than 500GB and the 4th one that I have used in recent memory (the other 3 were a generic one I assembled with a COMPUSA external HDD enclosure and a Western Digital 20GB HDD, the other was a SyQuest removable external drive (remember those?) and another brand-name 1TB). It's so small (smaller then my other 1TB drive) that it can fit in the corner of my emergency evacuation bag.The Seagate brand has been around since the birth of the personal computer era and, as both a user and a computer service technician, I had a history of generally good and reliable experiences with it. So, I was looking forward to a similar experience and, generally,I've been pleased.Oh, I forgot: just when I recently opened the box it came in, it slipped from my hand to the floor, 2 to 3 ft. “Game Over!”- I though. So,... with some trepidation, I connected it to my Windows 10 Home laptop computer and, Voila! It worked! Just in case, I downloaded and installed in my computer the Seagate's SeaTools for Windows and tested it overnight: passed. I copied the contents of my other 1TB external HDD to it. Rugged, isn't it. No issues, so far.Once I registered it by running the “Start Here Win” routine from the drive, I got to download and install the “Seagate DiscWizard”, a nifty program offered as bundled to clone, backup and restore drives and data files. I ran an Entire Computer backup (the equivalent of a full backup) of my laptop and it did it in 11 minutes and 39 seconds: not bad. Then, I tested restoring by deleting an image file from my regular user account, rebooted the computer, ran DiscWizard, had to enter my administrator's password, selected Recovery (the software's term for Restore) and browse down to the file I knew was missing and restored it to my user account. That was easy, but,... DiscWizard won't allow for incremental or differential backups. On the other hand, every time you run an entire computer backup, the program overwrites the previous backup. If you are backing up or recovering a laptop computer, be sure that 1) its battery is fully charged and 2) that its connected to its own AC adapter and 3) “backup fully, backup often”.A worst case scenario of the Seagate external drive becoming non-responsive or missing part or all your backup, may call for Rescue DATA RECOVERY SERVICES, included with the purchase of the drive. This is a plus (although, I prefer not to have to use it).I look forward to use it as my main backup device, while turning my other 1TB drive to a day to day external storage unit. Verdict: 4 stars!All photos (c) 2021 by reviewer."
4458,2,decent drive. funky dual USB connector. Why?,the drive was pretty decent and worked well.There are two annoying issues:1 the drive is shipped with some weird files in the root. What do I suppose to do with these? Am I expected to run the installers?2. drive uses one of those weird dual USB connectors. Which are not well defined and almost impossible to find a replacement.
4459,3,"Feels cheap, works","I ordered a 2TB, but the seller sent a 1TB. Unfortunately, I have to make it work. It feels very cheap. The nearest thing I can describe is it feels like a regular Nintendo game cartridge, but with thinner plastic. I could easily break it bending it with my hands if I had to."
4460,1,Failed in less than 6 months.,Failed in less than 6 months for my Xbox.Would not recommend.
4461,3,Worked for 15 months... now my Xbox won't recognize the drive,"I bought this hard drive to serve as a place to store media (movies, music, etc.) for me to play mainly on my Xbox, but sometimes on my PC. It worked just fine on my [first gen] Xbox One and then it also worked fine when I upgraded to the Xbox Series X. The problem that I'm having is that my Xbox will no longer act like this drive exists even though 1) the light is on 2) my ""games"" HD still works and 3) my PC can still read files off of it just fine. This change happened without warning: watched some TV shows off of it at night and the next morning it stopped being recognized by my Xbox.Before anyone questions if I've done my due diligence in trying to troubleshoot, yes, I have:>Power cycled 100x>Hard factory reset my Xbox>Verified Xbox has latest update>Reformatted and partitioned the drive>Replaced the USB cord>Everything anybody suggested on any online forum about these Seagate hard drives not connecting.Given the lack of people updating their threads to reflect that they've resolved the issue, I take it that I've got a junk drive now. My 2TB WD external HD still works just fine and I'm probably going to get another one to replace this broken one. This drive will probably now serve as a backup for the files I put on my new drive. I wish the warranty had lasted a little bit longer on this one.After reading reviews and fix threads, it seems that this issue is somewhat uncommon. But it seems that in every thread I found with this same issue and where they report the HD brand: they say they have a Seagate! i.e. there is not one reliable amazon review on the WD External HD where they report this problem. So, to Seagate: you've got an issue with these drives; I'm not the only one with this problem.So, to justify my rating:I would rate this with (2) stars given that it worked well, but only for a little over a year. But, because the HD still continues to work just fine with my PC, I have to give them another star. Would I recommend? Yes for PC but not for Xbox."
4462,1,"Worst drive ever owned. Ejects itself, slow writing, no password protection","Worst drive ever owned. Ejects itself, slow writing, no password protection. I've owned about 30 drives for my business over the years. I must say, this is the WORST.Nothing like wasting 3 hours trying to upload a 5GB file. The drive doesn't finish copying the file and ejects itself.Other external drives I have had no problem uploading this file. Thank God for the cloud. This also doesn't have any software upgrade path or way to password protect this drive. I'm tired of wasting money on drives like this. My 15 year old LaCie drives are still working great. FYI: I'm on a 2-1/2 year oldMac desktop with 32GB of RAM."
4463,5,Works Great for the PS4,Does the job you’d expect.
4464,2,"Worked well, but failed in less than two years",This drive seemed to work very well - quiet and fast - but one partition failed after less than two years of use and I couldn't reformat it. You'd think these things would last longer than 22 months.
4465,1,Broke out of the box,"Live and learn. Always try electronics as soon as you get them. I just plugged in the drive and it is broke out of the box. It will be discovered by my windows, I can created a new folder, but as soon as the copy starts the device becomes disconnected. Unfortunately my return window has closed. I waited too long to use it. wasted $63. I thought buying a Seagate would be better than some no name brand."
4466,5,Plug and go,"Simple to use, easy to set up."
4467,5,Very Cheap 10TB,I got this for my Xbox X and works very well.When it was on sale it is very good value
4468,1,DOA,Arrived doa and the case was scuffed as if not brand new. Returned for refund
4469,1,Wasted cash,It was unable to contain and transfer the data I bought it for that expressed purpose.
4470,5,Recommend,It’s great a product!
4471,1,Make sure you don't touch it when running,I used this product to store my game files on my laptop. Within a week the hard drive was already beeping indicating a failure that requires me to send it in for data recovery. Not worth the money if you plan on taking it anywhere. Just go with a SSD instead.
4472,5,Great purchase,This was a great addition to my media server.
4473,5,Has worked flawlessly since purchase,"It's hard to find a drive with perfect reviews - but this drive has performed flawlessly so far, Recommend."
4474,5,Super Liviano,Se cumplió con el tiempo programado para su entrega.Super liviano y se accesa rápidamente a los archivos.
4475,5,So far it's been perfect.,Ready to use.
4476,5,Works great!,"Just took it out the box, plugged it in to my Xbox x, it read it right away, asked to format and it did so quickly.Started using it for storage immediately.Great little device for extra storage and downloads!"
4477,1,Came broken,The item came broken and can’t seem to get a refund sadly but the item itself is a nice size and came very quickly
4478,5,It does come with a cord!,I couldnt be more happy! I got this for my ps4 and it works exactly as i hoped. It showed up on time and it was packaged really well. Plugs right in and instantly adds storage to the PlayStation. Before buying i thought it didnt come with a cord so I got an extra one but it does come with the right cord it needs. Its able to hold all 30 of my games so im extremely satisfied
4479,1,Does not work for ps4,Does not work for ps4
4480,5,Great for X-Box,Bought this for my kid for use on his X-Box to give more storage.It works great.Easy setup of literally just plugging it in to the USB slot and it is ready to install games on.There are difference sizes available so you are able to pick the one you need.We have two of the 2 and one 4 in use in my household.Everyone loves having them because they no longer have to uninstall a game to install a game.Highly recommend instead of going with an off brand.My husband has had his four for years now and not a single problem.
4481,5,seemingly Reliable,"Seagate is known for reliability, reason being I bought this product. I am a movie collector and I needed space to store my movies. Of course, I now have room to store music and other files as well. The only issue I have is that you never really get the amount of storage that is promised on the advertisement. The drive always saves a portion of that for ""functionality"".I'm resting easy because I have a Seagate Xbox drive and that drive rules! The warranty guaranties me a year, but here's to many more than that!I'm extremely happy with my purchase."
4482,5,Works,Works
4483,5,Works perfect for my PlayStation 4 holds all my games and backups,I love it would recommend it to everyone excellent device for the price
4484,5,Works good for PlayStation 5,I Recommend to get it for gamer 🎮
4485,5,Long lasting back up drive and support,Will not have to buy another storage back up system for years. Great and reliable product.
4486,2,This did not work on my PS4.,"Despite trying to format it, the playstation 4 would not accept it. See attached photos."
4487,5,Excelente producto,Excelente producto
4488,5,it works well,good
4489,1,Terribly slow device,This drive is so slow that it would have taken 10 hours to transfer a few hundred gb of data from my computer to the drive. Way too slow disappointing. Had to return and get a faster drive.
4490,5,got it for my PS4,"It's working for a PS4 external. No complaints. It doesn't move, so I can't rate durability as a portable unit."
4491,5,Excellente,Estoy contento con la compra
4492,5,Gets the job done!,I am using this with my PS4.It works.Not much else to say.It provides about 1.85 Terrabytes of extra space for my games at the cost of one of two USB ports on my PS4.
4493,5,Tiny powerhouse,"I used the 2 TB version of this drive to backup our two Mac Air laptops; it worked instantly with no fuss and no problems keeping two laptops separate (Time Machine).I used my existing USB to USB/C adapter, and it took a while for each half-TB initial backup but no issue as you can continue working.The 18 inch cable (included with the drive) was a perfect length for me, as the device is so light and small you can move it around with you easily!"
4494,5,best buy,i have bought 3 of thesewonderful
4495,1,Lost all my files,I Bought this seagate drive less than a year ago and it fried and I lost allll of my photos .. they said recovery starts at 600$ in order for them to try and get your photos not even a 100% guaranteed. Never waste your money on one of these products
4496,5,Good!,Love mine. I bought to store all extra photos i have works perfect for that.
4497,3,Not durable,"It turns out that this is not durable. I was warned by a friend to make sure it does not drop so I kept it in the case (purchased) as added cushion. It did drop but on carpet. Nevertheless, days after that incident it ceased to work. I could no longer read anything on the drive. Have to look for a more sturdy product."
4498,1,DRIVE FAILED AFTER 1 MONTH,I purchased this note even a month ago and it has failed spectacularly. I usually always buy my drives as portable drives so I can pull them out of the enclosure at a later date and use them internally. This one I did it right off the bat. It performed wonderfully up until just earlier. The drive started hanging occasionally. I went to try to de fragment it in hopes that it just needed to organize the drive. Nope stuck at 0% de fragmented for 2 hours. Tried using chkdsk. Hopefully later tonight I can salvage some data from it but I'm not optimistic. I will no longer be purchasing Seagate products as of now. I've had 5 dollar beat up used drives last years and this couldn't even last a month... how pathetic. Plus now I cant even get a refund for it because its out of its enclosure.
4499,2,Not really good,This doesn't work great on an Xbox. Since I bought it when I turn on my Xbox I have to keep unplugging the hard drive and plugging it back in for it to read my games. Sometimes it won't even work at all.
4500,2,The worst instructions and functions for using I have EVER seen,Just got it and have now spent 2 hours trying to get it to work with utterly confusing instructions.And of course customer support is now closed.Actually had to restart my Mac-Big Sur twice to get it to work at all.Maybe it is backing up now ... maybe not.
4501,5,Love this,Easy to use and set up - no problems!
4502,1,Died after first power outage,"Ordered on April 26, 2021, drive died on September 23, 2021. First power outage with the drive in use and it is no longer recognized by any computer in the house. STAY AWAY!"
4503,1,"Low quality, data loss","After three times of use the Hard drive started beeping and would never be found by any PC or laptop.After IT investigation, they concluded it's irreversible and they cannot even restore the data on it."
4504,1,Never worked,"Order this, tried to transfer data from another Hard drive, never worked, spent $$ on a IT, he told me it was defected, called amazon, they transfer me to the seller asking me for my CC number, for more money.... They will take more money from you, don't give it!!Thanks to amazon, I will be fully refunded ! Thank you Amazon!"
4505,5,Great product to purchase,I housed this product for my PlayStation 4.
4506,5,Grandson said it was Great,Bought for Grandson. He wanted it for Christmas to use for games.
4507,5,Great deal,"Easy to use plug in and play, used for original Xbox one"
4508,5,"Product was brand nee, great price","Product was brand nee, great price"
4509,5,Perfect,Perfect! Just what I needed. Very portable & lots of storage.
4510,5,Satisfecha :),"Super funcional, rápido y accesible. Carcasa ligera, requiere mayor cuidado. Satisfecha :)"
4511,5,"It works with my Mac, is light, and seems simple to use and unproblematic.",Said it all in the headline.
4512,4,100 MB/s 2TB Backup Hard to Beat at this price point,"The media could not be loaded. I got this for $60 from amazon and have been using it to edit HD video (1920x1080) from my camcorder and iphone, and been using it as a backup. The read/write speeds are over 100 MB/s. Thats megabytes, not megabits. For a single drive, non raid, that isn't an SSD, just a standard drive plugged in to usb 3.0, this thing is fast. Of course an SSD will be several times faster, but also several times more expensive. If you are editing 4k video, RAW camera footage, skip this and get an SSD. If you are looking for a solid, portable, inexpensive drive for backup, portability, editing HD video, its' hard to go wrong with this one."
4513,5,Works very good,It works very good I was surprised at how much I can save on it I do have an older Version of it this one seems to save stuff faster I like it if I need another I will buy again
4514,5,Works for formatting to download Xbox games,Bought external hard drives before this and they were only capable for music and pictures but this one was advanced enough to be formatted for Xbox/PlayStation games.
4515,5,great value,Physical size is great for portability.
4516,1,Tf,"Not 2 TB of storage, 1.81 TB."
4517,5,good,"good ,lightly"
4518,2,Didn't last a year,"I was really excited about this drive when I got it last year.Small, Lightweight, and faster than my old HHD.However a few days ago it started beeping at me.I took it a local repair shop and they told me the heads were stuck on the platters."
4519,5,De maravilla,Funciona perfectamente
4520,3,Compatibility Issues,The storage on product is amazing. Said it was compatible with Mac but upon plugging it in it gave issues to show up. Had to go on YouTube to see how to setup properly. Maybe a pamphlet can be placed in package on the steps as to setup for different OS.
4521,1,Died 1 Week After Product Support Expiration. Expensive Lesson. Unreliable Product.,"My Seagate was used very lightly, on my Mac, just as standard backup. It stopped working. My tech-support at my job looked into it and said that it simply, died. I bought it 9/13/19. It died 9/20/21. 1 week past the time for Seagate Tech Support to help me. Bummer. Coincidence...? Doubt it. :("
4522,5,Does its job with no issues.,"I've been using mine for well over a year now for my PS4, and I haven't encountered any issues with it. Great product!"
4523,5,Portable and easy to use,It is a good product and recommend to buy
4524,1,"Lasted one moth before it overheated and expanded, which resulted in losing everything.",Don't bother with the hard drive.
4525,4,Works as should. Use it to backup my laptop,So far so good. Nothing to dislike.
4526,5,Great Device,"This is a great portable device that holds a terbyte of your most important digital items. I use it to store my vast music collection, which saves me from having to pull out CDs when I don't feel like it. I have two of these. They are great options for storage."
4527,5,Great external hard drive,Great drive at the best price on the web
4528,2,Wouldn’t buy again,"First this is almost impossible to put together with the lack of directions. After about 2 hours I finally got it, but then realized I flipped a board and took it apart to put it back together again. Surely it was going to go together perfectly with the adjustment. But nope its wobbly. Nothing is secure or flush once screwed in. The only thing that saves this piece is putting the backing on which helps hold it together. I could lift the top section off without it. It will do the job for the price. But if I ever move it, it will be a throwaway piece."
4529,5,Good hard drive,Good to use and it is my second hhd.this is better than
4530,5,PS4,Easy sync with my PS4
4531,5,good quality,This did exactly what it needed to do and it is light and easily portable.
4532,1,This product is not up to the standards of Seagate Drives.,The product was delivered in a generic box - not from Seagate.It is made from a very cheap plastic and the first one sent couldn't not be formatted or used.This was an emergency back up purchase.Seagate is usually high quality and dependable... not sure whats going on with this.
4533,3,Idk,Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
4534,5,Everything you could possibly need in an external hard drive,"Fast, big memory on a budget by one of the most trusted brands!!"
4535,5,Faster than I thought it would be!I got 14TB.,"The media could not be loaded. I bought this 14tb seagate drive to backup my video files.I film for YouTube and wanted to organize video files from trips just in case I want to use them for future video projects.It works well.It is quiet, stays cool, and is faster than I expected.I should have bought it sooner.Hopefully it continues to last….I have no complaints.👍"
4536,1,absolute dirt,"came to meA. making loud noisesB. wire was chippedC. after all was said and done just to find out it didn’t workD. waited 15 days for it by the way, i know seagate isn’t trash but wow this is by far the worst"
4537,5,Good storage capacity.,This drive is easy to use and has good capacity.
4538,3,Not what it seems.,"When I hooked this up I noticed right off that it only holds 931 GB not NEAR 1TB that I paid for. It's also quite sluggish and it goes ""to sleep"" mid use. Then you have to unplug the cord to wake it up??? The Seagate that I bought years ago and believe me it was over 7 years ago, was MUCH better than this."
4539,5,As expected,Ordered this for use with PS4. Plugged it in and was able to format it quickly. I've now moved all of my digital games into the drive. I've had no issues playing the games on the drive. Product performing as expected. Will update if that changes
4540,5,Great product,I really liked how it was easy to get it up and running youtube is also there to help. I also have all my games downloaded now and don’t have to keep deleting games bc of space
4541,3,the port where the SATA cable goes stopped working..,"within a month after purchase the SATA port stopped receiving a direct signal, the port is messed up I had to wiggle it a bit to get to turn on, recently just failed all together.. countless games and playtime I fear are lost."
4542,5,Love it so far,Like it so far no issues easy to format to my Mac with the directions provided online. Needed something to free up space on my Mac book it’s a older model with low storage.
4543,5,It works,It works good
4544,5,It was good until stop working,"I had it for a time. Storing ps4 games suddenly stopped working.I format it and used it to store photos and personal videos. Stop working again and I list everything.😒 unfortunately, the storage is for backup and I lost my backup 😔 I willtry another brand."
4545,5,your xbox go to for storage,"i was not sure if this was the right drive to use for my xbox ..turns out it works like a charm ,,,setup was beyond easy and the load is fast very plesed with this drive"
4546,5,Amazing!,Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift so he could have more space for his Xbox one s and it worked perfectly! He was able to download most of his games and has a lot more space which is great considering he was only able to download about 5 games before I got this for him. We are both VERY happy with this purchase
4547,5,Great portable drive for backups or general use,"I bought this for file backups, it's been working great so far. No issues or problems. Very portable and lightweight, fits in a laptop bag easily. Transfer speed is good."
4548,5,Good drive!,"Comes with 1.81 tb, and formated in ntfs. Has a max read/write of about 150mb/s."
4549,5,Works great!,"This works great on my ps4 slim. Good storage, easy to set up. Before I could only store about 2 large games and 2 smaller games on my PS4 before it tells me there’s not enough storage to download or update anything. I got the 2TB version and now I can hold all my games. If you’re thinking of buying this, do it you won’t be upset."
4550,5,So good I got two!,These are so worth the money!
4551,1,Don't buy this drive...,This drive dies and stops and starts trying to copy files after two months of light use.Drive is defective...
4552,5,Cheap mass storage. What more could you ask for?,"If you'd told me 20 years ago that someday I'd be able to get a hard drive with 10,000 GB of storage for $199 (1.9 cents per GB) I'd say you're crazy. But here we are, living in a world of 18TB hard drives and getting a 10TB hard drive for a mere $199. Some of the reviews here complaining about speed problems either have a technical issue (like they're connecting to a USB 2.0 port), or they don't understand the speed limitations of spinning platters of metal like these hard drives.The 10TB Seagate drive performs exactly as I expected: read/write speeds around 70MB to 80 MB per second. It's not flash storage folks; this is as fast as it gets for a single hard drive.So long as the drive doesn't fail a year from now, I'm a happy camper with this purchase."
4553,1,I have had 2 of these fail with no possiblity of recovery,After the first fail I sent it in and they tried to recover it unsuccessfully.they sent me a replacement which I appreciated but a second one also failed months later.
4554,1,Buyer beware!LOST 4Tb of DATA,"4Tb portable drive was in use for 1 month. 4 days after the return period ended, it died. Not detected by laptop anymore.Now I have to deal with Seagate data recovery, not sure how it will go.If you want to waste money and time, and get headache about your data, then you an buy this.Most of the reviews are positive, but not all of them for this device. That is how seller cheats with reviews.Buyer beware !"
4555,5,Bought for Xbox series X,Some games you can store on drive and still play some you have to keep on local storage. I bought to free up room because COD takes up so much room. Modern Warfare was able to be moved and still played with game on drive. Freed up 200 gigs of space. The unplayable transferred games say you need a faster drive to play with it on the drive. For the price I’m not complaining and works good enough to free up a lot of space. Even if you can play it with game on drive it’s only minutes to transfer back to local storage then hours to re download game.
4556,1,product does not work,"I am an average person of average intelligence. Have learned to follow instructions over many decades and that I do well. When I buy a product, I expect it to work. I bought two Seagate drives to replace old portable drives before they went bad and lost a couple of decades of data/wok. I have spent two hours trying to follow formatting instructions and am getting nowhere. I have a brand new Dell Inspiron and it works just fine. I get stuck in endless loops taking me back to where I have been and when they say I should see this I don't see it. Am not about to gamble because the last thing I want to do is format a computer and worse while getting a portable backup drive to work. I see no point in formating a disk when I buy a disk it should be formatted. Then again, it's easier to just make one disk and let the user do all the work. I Am fed up with Seagate and hope never to see one again."
4557,1,Drive Crash- 3 times- 3 different drives,"Purchased June 2021 and issues in August 2021, bought another in October 2021 and then had issues with the drive in July 2022.Was scanning photos and placing them in files and all of a sudden things started to just delete themselves, could not find them anywhere on my drive.I was devastated then remembered I had purchased the data recovery plan.The second time could not access drive at all and it just beeped.I contacted them sent in my drive and so far it looks like they have recovered everything.Not sure if I would recommend product but would definitely recommend getting the data recovery plan.Have not yet contact the insurance for the second one.I DO NOT encourage anyone to buy this drive"
4558,1,Lost all my treasured photos…,"When I bought this and received it, I was impressed with the presentation. The case felt nice, the drive was sleek and lightweight, and I was able to transfer all my data from my aging hard drives. Those aging hard drives, though 5+ years old and having traveled across the planet a few times over were in fact still much better than this…I was able to transfer all my treasured photos, videos and documents (albeit VERY slowly) and all seemed well. I put the hard drive in the case in a cool, dark and dry area and left if for a few weeks. Translation NOTHING happened to the drive, it was stored very safely and with zero events that could constitute any sort of damage.Imagine my surprise when I went to write more photos onto the drive and despite the drive being able to be located on my computer (the same one I originally uploaded all my data from), the drive was however unable to be opened. All diagnostic checks said it was “functioning properly”, but it was essentially an inert icon.Went to Seagates site, no help. Tried three other computers with three other cables, no dice. Tried adjusting settings on the drive as per help tutorials, nope. Went to a few computer whizzes, nada.I trusted this decently priced hard drive with all my memories and it failed me spectacularly. I’d have been less mad if it simply hadn’t worked out the box. The only saving grace is that those older aging hard drives which have been through dust storms and general military craziness in Iraq, multiple airports, dropped and aged for years STILL work better than this.DON’T BUY! I don’t know what kind of shady crap allowed this to have such great reviews, but you really should listen to the swarms of negative reviews as I did not and I really regret that. The only thing I can think of is the positive reviews are either fake, sponsored or the writer simply hasn’t realized all their data is in imminent risk of being lost. It will let you down, and unless you have a backup (for this backup I guess…) you could lose all you data with apparently no chance at getting it back…"
4559,5,"Buen dispositivo,funciona muy bien, lo uso para almacenar juegos de Ps4 y hasta ahora va muy bien!","Trae por defecto un pequeño espacio ya ocupado, pienso que es de los drivers, pero como son2TB no se siente ese espacio ocupado."
4560,1,"Despite working for a few months and correct formatting, now it is ""read only""","Was working for a few month as a backup time machine, now I can no longer write on it, despite 5.9 TB free.Solution, you might ask? Well according to the internet, just delete everything, reformat it and try again - and then what, the same thing happens again a few months down the line? Absolute garbage.Also false advertising, which is why I give one star. Here is what I mean:The images do not show that you need to plug in an electricity cable, for some godforsaken reason, like it is Windows 95. So there is not just the harddrive-USB-to-computer cord, but also the harddrive-electricity-socket cord. Why are we still doing this?"
4561,5,Great buy,"Works great! It says 5TB but you really only get 4.7 TB or so, which is not unusual for hard drives."
4562,1,Meh,When received it was broken.
4563,5,Perfect,"The product came safe and sound and arrived here at its final destination in the same conditions. I have 0 complaints, great work fellas keep it up."
4564,5,Fast and reliable,Storage is good
4565,1,If you enjoy watching grass grow and paint dry.....,"then you will love this drive. Writing to it is super slow, we're talking its speed is measured in kb/sec. I have a new computer with 3.0 USB ports (blue) and the device drive settings in Windows set to ""better performance"" and it does nothing to increase the write speed.The good news is that this does give me plenty of time to look for a better external drive."
4566,4,Finally got it to work with my iMac,"It was a royal pain in the butt trying to figure out how to get this external hard drive to work with my iMac! I needed to watch a few videos online because I would continually receive an error message. First, you need to format this hard drive for the mac using ""disk utility"". If you receive an error or if it states that the disk is not recognized, you'll need to initialize it. Then you may also need to open it again in disk utility and run the ""repair"" option. It's worth the trouble because I was finally able to simply drag all my files over...what a relief!"
4567,5,Very satisfied with capacity and transfer speed!,"I’m extremely happy with this hard drive! It is the size of a box juice but wider. It’s very light and easily portable. My son and I have our own desktops. I got tired of his Roblox and Minecraft files infiltrating my computer. I gave him my desktop and got myself a new one just to realize any editing I was doing on Filmora for him was on my drive. Formatting this external drive was done with the MacBook. We have 2 desktops, MacBook and Chromebook. I find doing this with MacOS to be much faster because it took less than a minute to finish. Once that was done it was recognized just fine in Windows since I formatted it FAT32 or ExFAT (can’t remember). Moving files whether it was a photo or edited video for YouTube is extremely fast, almost instant experience. If I were to backup my entire PC to this drive, I’m unsure how long that would take because the info is cloud based for now. I also bought a case that stores the drive and the cable."
4568,1,Do not buy,Terrible product. Just stopped working after two months. Spent too much money for this to not even work
4569,1,Does not come with US plug!,Although it only ships to the US it comes with a european power adapter but none for the US. Smh!
4570,4,Good gift for gamer girlfriend,"Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend, she seems to find it useful for her xbox although in my opinion just spend the extra money and get a 5 terabyte."
4571,4,Didn’t need it after all,Didn’t end up working for what I needed it for.
4572,5,They have built these forever,Great product
4573,1,Broke after a month so all my stuff is gone,"Broke after a month, everything i saved on there is gone"
4574,5,Works great!,I did not have to put it to a power source and the device I use it on it runs straight from USB port!
4575,5,Its Great For Gamers,I Have All My Games Installed On This And It Keeps my Pc Running Fast Because I'm Not Using Up All Of Its Space
4576,5,Perfect pics and video storage,Small and easy plug and play action. As with all memory items runs short of claims in space by 5% but 4.8 Terabyte is just fine.. best I've found anywhere and inexpensive. Take it anywhere and plug in.
4577,1,Horrible Read / Write times,Just got this today and have been trying to clean the drive for 8 hours now. I’m very disappointed and would not recommend
4578,5,Great device,Small but mighty
4579,5,Item as described. Thanks,Item as described. Thanks
4580,5,External drive,"Great product, easy to move and use provides lots of storage space for all kind of files!"
4581,4,Great Drive - But not worth the money,"I have purchased 4 of these in the past, they are wonderful. But the cost is out of control. I paid as little as $128, and as much as $144, but $189? Price gouging, plain and simple. Seagate is becoming too greedy, and I will need to look elsewhere for my storage needs."
4582,4,Needs a power source … kinda upsetting,"So I got this a few days ago and finally got time off work to move all of my stuff around to it … just to find out that it does in fact need another power source, contrary to those claiming it doesn't. It in fact DOES. So that's a little upsetting as it took me a while to get all of my cords rearranged to even hook it up then, but aside from that seems to be pretty nice. Amazing storage capacity, nice and compact, and overall just a nice external. But for anyone looking at it do NOT believe the ""I just plugged it up no power source needed"" cuz it needs the power source. Box comes with several interchangeable plugs which is nice. It covers the a wide spectrum of plugs despite only needing one, but it's very very nice. Just make sure to have a plug or surge protector nearby cuz you'll need it."
4583,5,Muy bueno,Fantástico.
4584,2,Not recomendable for Backup.,"The unit started making small noises after one year, and it completely failed without any previous warning(except the noise) after less than two years.It didn`t give any SMART alarms.I could restore most of the info with Seagate recovery software, but not all, and i expected the unit to last a lot more than two years.Not recomendable for backup purposes."
4585,5,Perfect,I used this for more space in my game systems worked like a charm
4586,5,Good price,"Great price, plenty of storage for all my files and easy to carry around!"
4587,5,Awesome for Xbox,I use it for my Xbox one since mine could only hold 5 games. Now I got 20 and only quarter of way full I don’t have to delete and reinstall anymore I love it
4588,2,If I brought another one it'll be my 3rd one in two years they just stop working after,They don't last a year
4589,5,Use with PS5,Using this with my PS5. Works great
4590,5,AwesoMe,Loving it
4591,4,6 Months in,"it's a hard drive, not a solid state drive so I can't be here to talk about speeds.The product has been pretty good for 6 months now. 3 times within these 6 months I got a message saying it needed to be scanned or repaired of some sort. I didn't lose anything off it. But it was concerning. I download video games only onto it and play them from it and they have all seem to work fine. 4/5 Star, if the error message doesn't keep popping up every few months I would give it a 5."
4592,1,It’s straight garbage.,"After only using this for a month and a few days it is already acting faulty, not allowing my series X connect to the internet and not allowing controllers to connect. Completely trash don’t waste your money. Last seagate item I’ll ever buy. Very unhappy."
4593,4,A bit loud.,"Great capacity, I bought it to use it with my Xbox Series X. On the down side though, it's very loud My XSX barely makes any sound at all but this hdd really makes up for it. It's so loud that it can be annoying at times."
4594,5,Great Backup drive,Great Price and size
4595,5,Used to build raid. Perfect.,"I used those disks to build 20tb mini raid for archivesWorks perfectly, tried to work directly from raid in dvr 17.3.1 with Fhd material. I was surprised how smoothly it runs.4K footage better use ssd storage"
4596,1,Dead after 5 months!,Worked well ... until it didn't. Just about five (5) months in
4597,5,"Great archival drive, not the best for photo/ video editing","I buy these drives often for archival storage of film projects. They are reliable and have a great amount of storage for the price.The drives are slow compared to others, so I wouldn't recommend editing off these drives. But that's not really the purpose of these drives -- they're much cheaper than the faster drives so they're much better as a solution for stable archival storage."
4598,5,Worth the investment,I like the storage capacity and the easy to transport size. I really am happy with this purchase
4599,1,waste of time. DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY. I could not upload any of my pictures or videos into the memory. waste of time and money.
4600,4,Yes,2tb For creating Servers for 5M
4601,5,Very reliable,It was surprisingly better then a lot of the storage devices I’ve used and it wasn’t as big so it didn’t take up much room. It worked very well and it was very helpful for my Xbox one.
4602,5,Reliable and depndable.,This is third one we have bought. Once full with backups we archive them
4603,5,Just Works,"No issues yet. I've had several of these in the past and have been very pleased with them. If this one works as well, I'll be very pleased again."
4604,1,After a few months it stopped working :/,I use this to hold back ups for my Macbook but after not using it for a good month it stopped working. every time I plug it in it starts beeping and can no longer use it. Why does this happen I felt I wasted money..
4605,5,Great hd,Worked perfect with the ps4
4606,1,"Says compatible with PS4, but it isn't.","Says is compatible with PS4 but was not. Returned it, got my money back for the insurance plan but not the device itself."
4607,5,Ps5 must have,So small. And so much storage. Set up in 15 seconds. Great must have purchase for the ps5
4608,2,Failed after 6 months,"Using this as strictly a backup HD, it worked fine the first 5 months. I plugged it in this last time and it started the backup cycle fine, but I kept coming back after a few hours to find that the backup had not completed because the drive was disconnecting just for a second. I tried 3 different cables and 3 different ports on my computer to finally figure out that it is most likely the usb connector on the unit itself. The drive itself seems fine though, so I took it out of its case to use as an internal drive, only to find that they hobble drives to prevent this, such a waste. I am going back to WD drives."
4609,5,Would buy 10 if needed,Honestly this thing comes in handy all the time. I’m always carry it in its mesh case with its recharging cables but this thing LASTS. I still may buy another one or two….
4610,5,Great dvr storage.,Small storage box fits great behind TV.
4611,5,Great HDD,Great size and great product in general. Speed and size is perfect.
4612,5,love it,can put lots of pictures and videos on here.
4613,1,Worst portable storage,I bought thinking it was going to be good because it’s seagate it’s a trusted company and I was so wrong because this storage unit died and stop working after one week of use. My honest opinion just buy them at like Walmart or best buy it’s a lil pricey but it’s worth the money and won’t give up on u in a week
4614,5,So far so good!,Device works and transfers files quickly. No problems and the price of this was very decent. Gives you peace of mind with backing up your files or pictures.
4615,5,Did it’s job,Did it’s job and works well. Small enough to fit in your pocket. 10/10 would recommend.
4616,5,Excellant choice for mass storage on any computer,I qlso own a owcDock hub and only have one of 2 the drives mainlly cause im not sure f im gonna get stuck having tom use it as a backupDrive so thats why i want this route evrn thiugh cost qbit more atleast i know i jave the extra storage i need
4617,3,Need to Upgrade,"The description on this hard drive says that you can automatically back up your files. What they don't tell you is that you have to use windows backup to do it, or pay $39.99 to upgrade to unlock the features. So I set windows to back up my files overnight. It didn't happen and I had to wake up the hard drive to check."
4618,5,Use on TV,"I have some 3,312 TV shows and 375 movies and still is only a little over half full. We because of health reasons don't get out much. Having extra space is great, allowing for future shows and movies."
4619,5,Massive Storage,I actually bought two of these. One for my PS4 and the other for my PS5. No more out of storage messages plus as a Second hard drive I can be worry free when I download all my dlc packs!!
4620,5,Yep,Works as intended
4621,4,Fussy SATA cards,"The SATA cards fail a lot, so be careful."
4622,5,A Must For BootCamp On Mac With No Storage,"Such an amazing product for the convenience, price and storage! Wow this portable 2T external hard drive is a game changer! I’m a college student, and my MacBook Pro only has so much storage. I needed to download a few windows exclusive programs for a couple of my classes and this is just the trick! Because I didn’t have enough storage to download Boot Camp on the hard drive of my actual MacBook Pro, I use this external hard drive to do so and it has worked wonders for me. It’s easy to store and take with me whenever I do need it for class, and restarting my computer into it is not a problem. It does not make noise when I’m using it and it doesn’t cause my computer to overheat. I have downloaded BootCamp, Visual Studios, and MATLAB, Windows Office, and Zoom and it still has so much storage! 10/10 would recommend. It was also cheaper here on Amazon than at Target and Best Buy."
4623,5,Good for ps4,Love this storage device in able to plug it into my ps4 and play the games iv downloaded and then when um done I turn the device off and unplug it at the end of the night.
4624,2,"Too slow to wake up, read other reviews","I have this drive permanently connected to my work PC, so that I can occasionally transfer files to/from it and use it as a backup drive.Since it is slow to respond, it slows down the entire operation of the PC (the file explorer) and when waking up it has a significant delay. I should have read the other reviews about the low quality and not have chosen this one just because of its low price.Now the window for return has closed..."
4625,4,Works so far with only minor issues,"I bought this to clear up some disc space on my computer. It was very easy to use it, and make sure my files were stored properly. I am a little nervous about using it though, because after the first time I used it, every time I plug it in now I get an error message saying there was an issue with my files. When I run the check on it everything is fine and all of my files are there, but I am hesitant to save anything else on it out of fear they might be damaged or deleted. It has not happened yet but I am cautious."
4626,5,easy to use great product,Great storage option i plugged it in and it was recognized instantly by the PC. it is easy to use and lightweight.
4627,5,Perfect for my ps4,"Transferred everything to this to clear up my ps4 storage, compact and easy to use too"
4628,5,2 years later still massive amount of storage for Xbox,I must have close to 100 games on Xbox and still have 2tb left of storage
4629,3,its good but...,it works fine on an apple desktop however it doesn't fit in the usb port on my (HP) laptop.
4630,2,Not compatible with PS5,"I typed in PS5 external hard drive, this came up. It doesn't work. It is compatible with PS4."
4631,5,Pretty good!,"I got this for my PS5 since I needed more room to download more games and to play them as well so I don’t have to keep deleting other games just to make storage for new games that I wanna download! Just a heads up for those who own a PS5 and want to buy this, make sure you reformat the hard drive to exFAT or else it won’t support the PS5. First time I plugged it into my PS5, it didn’t support it so I had to reformat the hard drive. (:"
4632,1,DO NOT BUY,Horrible product. Always have to re download games and it does not always register on the consol. Do not buy
4633,2,Stopped working,"It was working fine for two months and then it stopped working. We tried troubleshooting, but it didn’t work. Very disappointing."
4634,5,Love it!,Super easy to install!
4635,5,It's working as advertised.,This is a replacement for a WD external hard drive that died the death. It was easy to install and has been doing the job without any problems.
4636,5,Very good,Very Nice product And very fast shipping
4637,3,Dead in 4 months,Product worked great for 4 months for my ps4 until it didn’t. Stopped being recognized by the ps4 and pc. Tech support processed a quick next day replacement. Hopefully it was just a fluke. If it happens again i will update. For the price its a great device but just lost 1.5 tb of game data and saves.
4638,4,eh,it’s not the fastest but it’s cheap and has a lot of storage so. if you want fast get an ssd
4639,5,Storage,Good price and fast shipping .we use it for our router
4640,5,bien de bien,Era lo que pedí y llegó en excelente estado
4641,5,Nice and good product,Good stores
4642,5,Great External Harddrive For Cheap!,"It was really easy to set up, came with the cable to connect to my ps4, and gave me and extra 1 1/2 terrabtyes of space! Compared to the price of other 2tb external harddrives out there it’s very cheap and still high quality!"
4643,5,One of the Best Hard dRive Brands out there,"There are only two external hard drive brands I trust for making backups of my computer systems. Seagate is one of those brands. I have never had a Seagate external drive fail me, and I've used them for many years. This one has good capacity, unless you have a massive video and photo collection. For that case I would go with a 4TB or larger drive. But for all else, this is a good, convenient capacity. The construction is solid, but not rugged. And performance is excellent, as I have come to expect from Seagate."
4644,5,More than enough space to store all my files.,I love that it downloads very fast. Very reliable.
4645,4,Bueno pero lento,"El disco trabaja bien, pero es lento comparado con otros de la misma capacidad y diferente marca"
4646,5,LOVE IT,"It helps me a lot, I had bought a hard drive from another provider and they scammed me, but with this new provider it arrived quickly and is very useful for me, I highly recommend it!"
4647,5,This is the 2nd one j've bought,no problemslots of extra storage now
4648,5,This thing is a steal!,"2t for only $60? Instantly sets up, no issues, and arrived early! Highly recommend!"
4649,1,"NOISEY ,WAY TOO NOISEY",What good is a noisy hard drive.Great if you're deaf. Terrible if your ears work
4650,4,WIN 10 AND 7,"I have three of these. They started out on the Win 10 machine. No matter what I did they would not stay accessible for more than four hours, often less. I tried all the fixes and still the only way was to unplug and replug them in. I moved these over to the Win 7 machine and they work fine. Now I off to find 25Tb of space that will stay hot on the Win 10 machine. I think it's the OS butnevertheless I have other other large drives that work with Win 10."
4651,5,Big Storage Capacity,Good for the value. Had a little trouble formatting it for use for my MacBook but found the instructions on Google.Otherwise this works well.
4652,1,Garbage Hard Drive. Stopped connecting doesn't even show up. Wish I never purchased this product.,Stopped connecting to my Xbox Series X and other consoles. Grand disappointment.
4653,1,Corrupt,Can't load games as it keeps saying they are corrupt
4654,5,Easy to use,"Just what I was looking for since Wz takes up a lot of space. I have multiple games on my console. If you are looking for something easy to use and simple, I highly recommend you buy this."
4655,4,👍,"Perfect fit for my 2TB external hard drive. Like the ""bubble"" protection and detachable lanyard. I'm going to get another one for my web cam (why don't they come with cases??), cut ""bubble"" protection out to make more room, then just place it on top before zipping it up."
4656,5,Easy to Use,Just plug it in and it starts copying files.
4657,5,It works.,The hard drive works exactly as it should. Gives more space for my Xbox One.
4658,1,Won't work,This worked or a week the all of a sudden wouldn't show up on any device I plugged into.
4659,5,Works well,Works well.
4660,1,Less than 2TB,This is supposed to be 2TB but it is only 1.81 TB!!!
4661,1,Busted,"It was working fine , then it just stopped working . Computer can’t read it nor can my PS4 . Worked for 1 month ."
4662,5,Great Value!,Works without problems. What else can I say?
4663,5,these drives work great,"I've been using Seagate backup drives for years and these ones are no different, they work great and get the job done"
4664,5,Works as expected!,Works as expected!
4665,2,Slower than my 2010 Seagate drive,It could be that my new drive is formatted to exfat and my old drive is formatted to Mac. I'm on a Mac. But this new drive is so slow that it's absurd. I'm going to have to buy an SSD drive because I can't stand how slow this is. What's even the point of usb 3.0 if this thing is slower than my 2010 Seagate drive? Trash.
4666,5,Easy to use,Size and ease of use
4667,1,TRASH ASF !!!!,"I have had this for a few months now & out of nowhere it's saying my drive is completely full, only this is there is NOTHING on there, and I've tried everything and nothing will fix it. DONT BUY THIS CRAP .. bought for xbox.."
4668,1,TOTAL FAILURE AFTER 2 DAYS,Used with my new Mac...total failure after downloading my backup files...can't return because of too many personal files...CATCH 22
4669,5,A MUST have for gamers!,Exactly what you need. Works for my ps5! I can play ps4 games directly from the hard drive. Ps5 games no. But that's fine for me as most games that are out are still ps4 versions. Gta V and Modernwarfare/Warzone are on the hard drive and work just as they should. Took me 15 minutes to move modernwarfare which is about 200 gigs for me. Gta about 10 minutes.
4670,5,Good external drive,Great place to back up files.Plenty of room and fast loading.
4671,5,4 TB sleek mate finished slim Hard Drive,"This works great. Look nice, easy to use, and small enough to hide out of the way. Good product, good price"
4672,5,I dont think this is actually a spinning disk,"If I opened the case I would probably find a circuit board and a weight inside.Theres no mention of its RPM speed, so its really a solid state device.Thats even better.Always concerned about dropping it or subjecting it to magnets etc."
4673,5,3rd one,So far no problems. This is the 3rd one I've bought for various this and never had a problem. If you are looking for fast transfer speeds forget it. The disk storage scheme it not designed for speed. Just large storage.
4674,5,Great External Hard drive!,This is a greathard drive! Holds a lot of data and is light weight. I will be getting anther soon!
4675,4,no issues yet,works well.
4676,1,Garbage lasted only 2 months,Worked for only 2 months. Just long enough for return window to close. Its conplete garbage
4677,2,Zero files survived a drop,"I'm not buying seagate again. This drive broke completely after one fall, all files were lost. Yes, dropping it was my oops, but I've had HDs that withstanded worse."
4678,5,Got only 1.8TB space,Got only 1.8TB space
4679,1,Terrible,Burned out in one month. Cheap garage.
4680,1,Worked great...for 2 months.,This hard drive worked the way it should for less than two months.All of a sudden the power light no longer comes on and it isn't detected by my computer.So I can't access anything I had saved on there.I've never written a bad review before in my life...so you can imagine how dissapointed i am to write this.
4681,1,Broke after 2/3 weeks,It broke after 2/3 weeks. I was carrying it around a lot but I was taking good care of it and never dropped it or squished it.
4682,5,External Hard Drive,Plenty of space to store my PS4 and ps5 games
4683,5,Easy to use!,"Just plugged it into computer and it did its job. I didn’t believe it actually backed up my pc because it was so easy. But I checked, it did!!"
4684,5,Nice,Love my Seagate.
4685,5,Good Value,"This was a perfect replacement for my last Seagate portable external drive.I got about twelve years out of the last one, so I am cautiously optimistic about this one.I only use it to back up my Macbook, so I really don't take it anywhere.Fifty bucks for a terabyte of storage is a pretty good value, so I would certainly recommend it to anybody thinking about purchasing a hard drive."
4686,1,It’s broken lesser than a year,Terrible product! I have an important data and it’sbroken lesser than a year also the support is slow and not responding.
4687,5,Great product for a great price,I have been looking for a external Hard Drive that was affordable from Seagate and I am happy to say that they have not disappointed me on this hard drive. Great purchase.
4688,5,good for backup storage,"i got this for backup storage, it works."
4689,5,Reliable and easy to use,"This is the third Seagate portable drive I have bought for my various computers (Macs).They work immediately for a Mac.Too soon to talk about longevity, but one of the others I own has been running well for several years."
4690,5,Works great,It was simple to store data in and I feel like I have tons of space for my files thank you
4691,4,Good product,This item does working for ps4 unless it could affect your controller getting delayed when downloading or updating in your hard drive. If downloaded completely then it won’t get delayed but sometimes controller delays will drop few times. That depends our Internet connection or whatever it is.
4692,5,Does its job!!,Nothing else to say.
4693,5,Good item. As described.,Works as intended.
4694,4,Not Bad,Been able to stores games from Xbox without any issues.
4695,5,No brainer,Easy install. Works great.
4696,5,Perfect for Xbox one and Xbox one S.,"Perfect storage for games, movies, and files.I love the ease of use and dependability for Xbox One S, I bought a few more for my family members"
4697,4,Working Ok. Cheap plastic body.,"For this company they should install better plastic body of hard drive. Plastic looks really cheap and flimsycompare to my old Toshiba , I would not risk to move around in case drop it, for desktop only,but inside working ok."
4698,1,Doesn’t work,It worked for a few months before going out. Waste of money.
4699,1,Worked for less than 1 week,"Worked on arrival, died about 3 days later. Unable to access the drive to erase it so I cannot return it because the disk still contains sensitive financial information.Trash."
4700,5,great item for my ps5,has lots of space. worked on my ps5 great. easy to use
4701,5,Came as advertised,Item works perfectly. Thank you.
4702,5,Is a Hard Drive,"Does what a hard drive should do, bit slow to transfer data, but it's a hard drive, so yk"
4703,2,Worked only for so long,Ordered this for my husband and it worked for a time but then it just quit reading on the Xbox. It turns on and lights up but it won't read. Upsetting as he lost ALL his things he had saved.
4704,5,Does it’s job,Does it’s job good
4705,5,Buen equipo,Es rápido y funciona bien
4706,5,I bought this for my son’s Xbox series,My son loves this. Holds all of his games that the Xbox doesn’t have room to store. He said it’s awesome. The price was incredible.
4707,5,Works with my router,I connected to the USB port on my router so I could transfer files to nd from another computer.I have had over a month and no problems. Never had to contact Tech support.
4708,2,Do not get for a Mac computer,"I attempted to get this for my mother in law to backup her Mac computer. It would not let me backup the computer until I reformatted it. I changed it to the extended (journaled) format that was recommended and it still would not allow me to do anything. I cannot speak to its performance on a PC as I have not tried it, but I would not get it if you have a Mac computer."
4709,1,Randomly stopped working and I lost work,Look for something more reliable. Write speeds are slow and it randomly stopped working and made me lose an hours work.
4710,5,Great bang for your buck!!,Great speed and durability
4711,5,This is my 2nd buy! LOVE this product,This is my second buy of this make and model external hard drive. I still have soooo much room left on my 1st one but bought this one since I now am creating and making video for YouTube and I wanted to make sure I had this as a second backup for everything and also have for saving everything needed to create. If you are looking for an external hard drive this is an AMAZING one!
4712,5,The disk works as advertized,Good disk
4713,4,"Fast enough, easy, good as a backup drive, white LED is annoying","It’s fast enough and very quiet, good price and high quality. When my computer backs up at night the flashing white LED on the top is very bright and annoying, I covered it with tape."
4714,1,"si tienes Mac, no compres esto","para mac? esto no es para ti, aunque dice que es compatible."
4715,5,Quality of the product.,I like the quality of the product.I use the drive for backup of files.
4716,1,stopped working within a year,Would disconnect and connect like usual and suddenly it corrupted most of my files and would not show anything in my folders. After a while it began to freeze my entire computer and I wasn't able to use it any longer.
4717,5,"Fast shipping, nice usb speed.","Plug into usb 3 port if possible, transfers and pulls files quickly. Seems durable."
4718,5,Great back up,"Purchased this drive one day after my computer would not start.Wanted a backup drive in ""case"" I lost my hard drive or computer.Windows does automatic back up so needed something online continuously.Love the size both in capacity and portability,"
4719,1,Only lasted 8 months then died,"I bought this thinking I would have a reliable external drive to back up my photos and embroidery patterns.Imagine my surprise, disgust and rage to find that after only 8 months the drive no longer functions.Yes, I will start the process of trying to deal with the warrant claims department and customer service, but I am afraid I've lost so much."
4720,5,Works perfectly to store my PS4 games files,Got it because I ran out of space on my PS5. I move all the game into this drive and it’s was very easy and fast.
4721,5,Good product,"I like it, its small to put on top of any ps4 or xbox one. Got the 4 year protection just in case"
4722,5,Good purchase,"Out the jump it linked with my console immediately transferred some games from my console onto the device. They load perfectly, while still keeping my console space. Would be great to switch with a series x and not have to redownload all my games."
4723,2,The hard drive is 5400rpm.Don't go there,"5400rpm is very slow these days. 7200rpm is the standard. Unless you don't mind running out to get coffee during tasks, steer clear."
4724,5,Good,Good
4725,5,Recommended by my tech guy,Super easy to use.Very portable.
4726,4,I like it,So far so good
4727,5,Amazing,This works great I have had mine (2 Tearabyte) for over three years now and it works amazing. Nothing bad has happened.
4728,1,This 2 TB model is NOT compatible with Macs.,Don't be fooled by the ad on Amazon for a drop and drag ext. hard drive by Seagate. Maybe with PCs but not with Macs. Couldn't drag and drop anything. False advertising. Amazon should remove the product from their line of hard drives or at the very least make Seagate state that the product does not drag and drop for Macs. I've run into this problem with many other products. Western Digital is the only one that I've found that works by dragging and dropping for Macs - also La Cie.
4729,5,Reliable,"I've had problems with external hard drives in the past. I've found that, for me, Seagate is more reliable, so it's the one I always buy."
4730,5,So far so good.,The product came as it was descripted. I just got it and I'm already giving it a lot of use. Will review again in the future if anything changes.
4731,5,Buy this instead of the expensive XBOX version. Works just as great!!!!,"Order this one. It's so easy, efficient, and inexpensive. DO IT!"
4732,5,disco duro seagate,"excelente de gran capacidad y velocidad de traspaso de información, llego rápido y en perfecto estado, además de contar con soporte para la recuperación de datos (en caso de necesitarse). Le daría 5 estrellas en portabilidad si al menos viniera con estuche básico."
4733,5,Hoping it lasts 14+ years like my other HDD!,"After researching like a mad man on what is the best way to store photos, I came to a conclusion— unless I want to pay a flat fee for cloud storage; an external hard drive was the way to goMy Seagate from 2008 is still going strong, but I was petrified when I recently found out that Hard Drives are not permanent storage solutions. So I'm going to be buying Hard Drives every 2 years and make backups of my backups as a precaution.The size is good and portable, and it's a respectable price point.I chose a HDD over a SSD because SSDs could lose the memory instantly since they're magnetic and they're not as good for long term dormant storage like a HDD"
4734,5,Storage ps4,"Just what my son need, now no more deleting games!!"
4735,1,"1st one arrived broken, 2nd has random errors and a weird vibration","I have used Seagate in the past and loved it (no issues with my 5TB drive from them), and really wanted to like this drive. The first one amazon shipped wouldn't show up on Windows 10, and when I scanned it in the partition, it had a ""fatal hardware flaw"". I exchanged it for another one, and this one seemed to be working fine for the first two days, but a couple of hours ago a notification popped up saying there was an issue with the drive and to scan it and fix it. I did so, but WIN10 didn't find an error. Weird. Now the drive appears to be working fine, but it now has a really noticeable (and really annoying) vibration that goes off every few seconds, sort of like a quick notification vibration on a smartphone. Anyways, I really wanted to like this drive, but the first drive being broken and now this error message and vibration issue has made me lose trust. I'm going to see if any additional error messages pop up, but may need to return it as the vibration issue seems like a hardware problem that could become significant down the line."
4736,5,la capacidad,"mjuy buen producto, lo recomiendo"
4737,5,GREAT,GREAT
4738,4,Read speeds,"Great product. Great price. BUT my only complaint is that it is not as fast as a hard drive. If you’re like me, and thought that this would work good for games, it does, however the download speeds on it are atrocious. Other than that, great product 10/10 would recommend."
4739,5,good hdd,"good, works great"
4740,1,Did not work...,Did not work.Sent back.
4741,5,Hard drive,Love how compact it is and easy to use.
4742,5,Works great,Perfect for my PS4
4743,1,After 4-months it no longer works,"After 4-months it no longer works, tried to open it on 2-pcs"
4744,1,Doesnt work,Wont let me set it as the scratch disk on photoshop or let me store anything on it. It only works as a time machine for my laptop
4745,1,Crashed after one use. Lost pictures/videos,Crashed after ONE use. Lost all the pics and vids I stored on it. I spoke with Seagate support for literal hours (took forever!!) and they did say they could try to save lost files since the device was corrupted BUT I would not get refunded for the product but rather would be sent a replacement harddrive. I don't trust these harddrives at all after this one died almost instantly and after losing those pictures so I just returned to Amazon instead for a refund. I switched to an American made external harddrive. Will never purchase Seagate again. Built cheaply and poorly. Very disappointed! 10 year anniversary trip pictures and videos lost forever.
4746,1,Garbage. Can't handle basic functions like zipping and extracting,"The hardrive started off fine, could handle multiple files of varying sizes like videos,music, etc etc but shortly after purchase I had my first crash on the hardrive when trying to transfer a video.If you only need this hardrive for small files and storage it will be mostly ok. But anything slightly large or medium sized will give it problems. I've had the hardrive full on reset while trying to zip and extract files countless times. Not even close to half of the storage taken up.Wouldn't recommend installing any programs or game onto the hardrive as it takes so long to load it will surely hinder performance. I honestly don't know who this device could be for. Maybe a student or someone who really doesn't need to Access data but only store it.Horrible don't recommend"
4747,5,Exactly as promised.,Exactly as promised.
4748,5,My son likes this,My son is using it for his Xbox for more memory and it works if he is happy I’m also happy. 😃
4749,5,Does what it does,Very good! It works well and just like what it says.
4750,5,Easy easy,"Compact, easy to use and great fit for bookshelf storage."
4751,5,So Far So Good,For a guy that was asked to pay $2000 for 200MB hard drive back in the 80s I am amazed the cost of storage has dropped and I've always had long-lived USB Seagate storage.
4752,1,Corrupted,"It was working until one day, It gets corrupted and all of my games deleted and start over again. Not sure how that happened, so random"
4753,1,Not for Mac laptops!!!!,It was too difficult to adapt to a Mac laptop.
4754,5,4 tb hard drive,Great product easy to use and is just as described
4755,5,"Great USB drive, plug and play",We are using this as an external drive for our photos. Easy to use no problems.
4756,5,NICE!,"Very Nice, Dead-Silent but fast. Thank you Seagate."
4757,5,Perfect for Xbox Series X Expansion,Bought this to triple my storage capacity on my Xbox Series X. Plugged the hard drive in and it was instantly recognized and formatted for game downloads. Unit is small and quiet and can be placed behind Xbox Series X with zero visibility.
4758,5,"Great device, 2 TB is plenty of storage.","Before this drive I had roughly 6 games on my console. A lot were smaller 5-15gb games as Red Dead took up most of my space. Now I’ve went from 5 games to 25 and still have an insane amount of space left. If you’re not a crazy hardcore gamer and just want a reasonable amount of games 2TB is more than enough. Only trouble I had with it was my vertical cooling stand that plugs into the USB port(also) was interfering with the drive, so I can’t use it anymore but it’s not a big deal, drive worked after I unplugged the stand."
4759,5,Amazing,For the price this works perfect for my ps4!
4760,5,Good buy!!,It works just fine!
4761,5,Reliable!,Been using it with a y cable to store games on my Wii U and with no hiccups after 2 months its still fast
4762,1,Drive broke after 1 month,Litterally can’t access any of my games on thehardriveAnd is very disappointed in hard drive recovery
4763,1,Dead after 1 year of almost no use,"Seagate has a good reputation.However...I've been struggling for a couple of days now with this drive working intermittently. Now, it will not work properly. The computer sees it, I can watch it connect in the message log (linux), then fail. It fails with Windows. Fortunately this was only going to be used for backups. I'd hate to waste the money on recovery, especially after wasting money on this.I'll be avoiding Seagate from now on."
4764,4,I use this for extra space for my PS4,Works great for PS4 storage! It does have to 'repair' if your PS4 gets unplugged or shut off improperly but it takes like a minute and its good to go. Definitely recommend.
4765,5,PS5,This storage device works great for additional PS5 storage.
4766,4,Not so noisy but seems a bit slow (see attached),"Just received my Seagate 10GB HDD and it is not so noisy but seems a bit slow (see attached)... I can hear the R/W process, but I wouldn't call it loud... However, as you can see in the attached image, there is an estimated 5+ hours left to transfer a little over 1TB.That seems pretty slow, am I wrong?It is well packaged so it arrived at my home in Chile in perfect condition.It comes with a variety of wall plug types, including one for Chile, which was nice.We've come a long way since my first PC in 1988 which had a built-in 20MB HDD!"
4767,1,Defective drive.,"My drive arrived defective, as verified by Seagate technicians (online and via phone) in their repeated and unsuccessful attempts to reformat this to Mac computer."
4768,5,Works great!,I ordered this for my husbands PS4 and it worked great! Now he can save all his progress!
4769,5,Great,"Great price, great capacity. Perfect to store documents, perfect for office work."
4770,5,Works As Expected,Great product. I was so nervous because my last external hard drive was getting very old. This one has so much more space and does the trick!
4771,1,Constantly Crashes,"If I could give this product a negative star rating I would, to say this drive is fickle is an insult to fickle things everywhere. I can't go 5 minuets without it crashing and closing all open windows, doesn't matter if those windows are from the files on the drive or not. It really does not like idea of moving files, or opening files, or looking at the files Icon, opening a folder on another drive. Basically, if I do anything with folders on this drive I risk having to do a hard reboot of my computer. As soon as I can get another drive to move my folders to, this POS is becoming target practice, hopefully it will last that long and I won't loose all my data on it. I wouldn't even be heartless enough to give this to my ex-wife"
4772,1,It stop working,It’s stop working
4773,5,Very convenient,"Lots of storage for data, convenient, and love that is easy and portable."
4774,5,Que tengo un Backup de musica y Fotos,Yo soy Disc Jockeyen PuertoRico
4775,4,Saves things.,"It does what it is intended for but I took a star away because I cannot resize files that are saved on it. For example, if I have a picture that needs to be resized for a particular program I have to resize it and save it on my desktop first and then move it to the hard drive. Those extra steps are inconvenient."
4776,1,This product was recognized by the USB but would not open or allow data to be saved.,"This item was purchased for data storage and backup.It was not useable, it would not open... it only emitted a beeping sound."
4777,5,Fast,"Great product, I’ve been using it with my ps4 really fast to be a HDD, never crash, it’s been a month and so far pretty good, fast shipping to Colombia, about 6 days, I totally recommend it."
4778,5,Review,Just what I needed
4779,5,good way to keep for pictures,liked it
4780,2,Extremely slow speed,"As others have already mentioned, this hard drive is extreme slow!"
4781,3,"Bought it in January for xbox, burnt up in about 8 months","Great for storage, longevity and protection can be better"
4782,5,Huge amount of storage,"This product solved my problem with all of the photos I saved and stored, plus so much more.Now I don’t have to delete any photos."
4783,5,Works great,Right out of the box it works great. Hooked it up to the PS4 for the kid. After formating it hold close to 800BG on a PS4.
4784,3,"Correction: I said the drive was only 10.91TB. It has a 12TB capacity, but formatted is 10.91 TB","Correction: The drive DOES HAVE a 12TB capacity. I was not interested in a rescue drive, but 12TB of storage sounded great!The drive was partitioned with most of it going to the Rescue Drive function. I removed the small partition and expanded the large partition to cover the entire drive, and then formatted it using NTFS. The result being 10.91TB."
4785,5,1 terabyte easy to use,Fast in USB 3
4786,5,Very good 2gb' s of space,I have this for my playstation 4 is my playstation 4 because you really need you need some more space and so far with the addition of other games that I put on there especially warzonethey are the ones that take up the most space space even with updates is still doing very good I have not had to delete anything from The hard drive so so it works very well no problems I recommend it
4787,1,Failing after a year,"I hadn't even started using this drive for about 6 months after receiving it in the mail. It has stayed home plugged into my desktop only (on and off, depending on my need to use it). I've only used it to store data (no gaming, no streaming). I've only stored up to 2.5TB of data before noticing files were not able to be written and file transfers freezing. After clearing all data and formatting and repairing with various software, it still runs very slow. After running a Short DST with the Seagate software, it returns info that the drive FAILED (10%) less than a month after the warranty ended. I just contacted support to see how they will help me with this. If that is it, then that was a waste of $100. I will update this review if they are willing to help me. If they will not assist me or will attempt to charge me to assist then I will never trust purchasing a Seagate drive of any kind again."
4788,4,Good Portability Well Made,This Harddrive is well made and the size and price are great.
4789,4,good,nice
4790,2,Contains 3.63 TB of space when advertised as 4.,Advertised as 4 TB but only contains 3.63. Not a deal breaker but definitely disappointed with the false advertisement.
4791,4,"great hard drive, stores lots o games",i used this for games on my xbox 1. very easy to set up and stores a bunch of games. every game has a different amount of GB but i went from 3 to 19 games and still have room. my only complaint is that when i turn on my xbox the notification that the hard drive is connected sometimes spams on my screen till i click it. sick tho
4792,5,so far so good,"It does what I need it to do- it holds a s***t ton of movies and shows that we stream direct from the hardrive to our computer. So far all is well, it doesn't lag and always shows up on the desktop (knock on wood)"
4793,1,Very slow transfer speed for PS5,Bought for my PS5 believing this would be fast. I was wrong. It is sore but it works. If your looking for fast transfer speed keep looking this isn’t it.
4794,5,Customer review,Very handy and portable may purchase more in the future
4795,5,Very portable and small which work out perfect for me,You full capacity on this drive
4796,5,So good so far.,Fairly quick.
4797,1,Excruciatingly slow,Purchased this to function as the backup to my hard drive via Time Machine. Looks like it will take more than a month of constant running to back up 2.4 TB.
4798,5,"Excellent Product, So Far.",I saw a few reviews that said how slow it was. I got mine and started moving my full2 TB harddrive over to my new 5 TB. It took overnight and it was finished.I like it.
4799,5,Worked Great.,Worked backing up my data. Would recommend.
4800,5,Excelente Producto,Excelente producto rápido compatible con xbox series x y con ps5!!!!!
4801,5,As described,"Very easy to use, like a thumb drive. So far I haven't had any problem. I am not using it to store videos, but my work load as an architect. Lots of images and plans."
4802,1,Disconnects often,"Device consistently disconnects from the Xbox, kicking me out of games downloaded to it."
4803,5,Love this thing,"this thing is amazing, my old hard drive was slow and corrupted frequently whereas this one is very fast and has never let me down. I can finally have peace of mind knowing my files are in a safe place. I fully recommend, great product."
4804,5,Excel te disco duro,2tb muy rápido al momento de pasar datos pesados
4805,1,Not Mac Friendly,This is second time I bought a Seagate product that markets itself as “Mac Compatible.” I’m not a tech person so when I plug it in and then have to go through a formatting of the drive that is the first problem. Then the formatting didn’t go as planned and all of a sudden the drive is broken. If you are a Mac user I would suggest getting a drive that is Mac exclusive. You plug it in and it’s ready to go.
4806,4,he was happy,he happy with it
4807,5,Great,It's great to have for games that require a large amount of data.
4808,5,Great Value!,"When I saw this external that is compatible with my PS4, I jumped on it, and it is well worth the price! It was a piece of cake to set up to use with the PS4"
4809,5,Storage,Works as designed
4810,5,works on my xbox series x,these item works great on my xbox series x
4811,1,2 1/2 years and it failed.,So only 2.5 years in and it will not mount in order to erase/repair/anything.I have older external hard drives that are chugging right along.I won't ever buy a seagate product again.
4812,5,Definitely get,I was legit worried about it not working for my Ps5 but no joke it does work so I’m happy about it
4813,5,nice,top
4814,1,Junk,"I plugged this into my computer and followed the Seagate instructions on how to format it to my computer. Halfway through the process, it said that the drive was unrecognizable on my computer.I tried plugging it into two other computers, same response. An hour later chat with customer service, they are sending me a replacement, but I have to pay the shipping to send the faulty one back. Will never purchase from this company again."
4815,5,Average,Average product. Very simple to set up.
4816,5,Great storage solution,Worked as expected was looking for a storage solution and saw this was deal and jumped on it one of my better purchases for sure.
4817,5,Works great for Xbox,This drive works well for Xbox memory expansion. Fast and easy to plug and play.
4818,1,Disabled Software Robbery,"I was very disappointed that not only does this product cost $7 shipping with no option for cheaper delivery to non-prime members, but this product doesn't even allow you to add password protection to the drive without paying $37 dollars to unlock software to do the most basic features.Buyer beware."
4819,4,It Works 🤷🏽,Its not a full tb its like 986gb but other then that it works perfectly fine.
4820,1,Lasted 1 year and 3 uses!,"Used it to backup my computer data once about a year ago. tried again today, didn't work & wouldn't even get recognized by the computer. Not exactly the most durable of items.."
4821,4,Mayor Espacio de almacenamiento,"The media could not be loaded. Su capacidad de almacenamiento es bueno para el costo que tiene, agregaré mí experiencia sobre el soporte técnico cuando lo conecte a mí laptop."
4822,5,Great little drive for an infrequent user,I bought this to back up the data for my Plex server. We have a little over 4TB in movies and TV shows on our server. We wanted to back that up because if anything happened to our computer that would be a really big nightmare to reload our entire library. I knew loading that much data was going to be a lengthy process but holy moly I really underestimated how long it would take. Id load big blocks to upload while I slept and before I left for work and it still took days. Literally days. Plural. For us its a pain but its fine. Once its loaded its loaded and done. I wouldn't recommend this for someone that is regularly moving big files around. You'll end up pretty frustrated.
4823,5,Great amount of space,"I used this to transfer games from the one X to the series S.Soon after I came to realize, at no fault of this product, that this product would not support next gen games as they need to be stored on a SSD or internal storage. Had I done My research, I would have known, however don’t be me now you know."
4824,5,Lots of storage,"Very nice, lots of room for my games on Xbox, still haven’t run out and I have 50 games, my last one was $70 for 2T so $100 for 5T is a great deal"
4825,1,Dead after 5 months,Will not be recognized by any xbox or computer after 5 months
4826,1,Product does not work. My IT team could not figure out why as well.,Computers can see the device however the device will not accept and data. My IT team tried to get it to function properly with no success.
4827,5,Great product,I love how easy the setup was is helps my games run smooth and I can have more games downloaded to my Xbox 🎮
4828,5,"Hooked to Xbox One, works perfect",Perfect for expanding storage on Xbox One.
4829,5,Best bang for the bucks!,"This works perfect for our needs, so much so we have purchased 4 total!"
4830,5,Exactly as shown,Perfect
4831,5,Light Weight and Compact,I already owned a 1TB Seagate Exteral Drive and liked how efficient and easy it is to use.So I was very pleased with this newer model. It is much lighter and smaller for the same amount of storage. It’s perfect my needs. I only use it to back up my laptop and as external storage for photos and docs. I plan to purchase another for my daughter to backup her college laptop.
4832,1,Failure,This hard drive failed after only one month of use.
4833,1,Not durable,"My daughter dropped this on the wood floor in our house and it stopped working. There are no visible dings on the case, but the local computer store said it is beyond repair. I must mail it to a company in California that can extract the data now. I expect better durability from a portable product."
4834,5,Awesome find,I actually bought this for my church because we are not doing much of the work inside the church office anymore due to the pandemic. It's perfect for our needs and small enough to carry in my computer case or in my purse. I'm excited to have something to keep our records on when I'm not at the church.
4835,5,Easy to instal and it works,This backup was very easy to instal and it has been working perfectly since we got it.
4836,5,They work fine,They work fine
4837,5,Plenty of space for games,It works great as a backup for my PlayStation
4838,5,Great!,Plenty of space- just plug and go. Used for son's PS4
4839,5,Works great with Time Machine,Works great with Time Machine.I have not used Tech Support
4840,5,Sleek an amazingly fast downloads,Perfect for the average gamer. It comes with enough space to fit well over 200 titles so a great buy.
4841,5,Everything was perfect,I recommend moving your games from your console to this over night cuz it takes a long time.
4842,1,Scammed!So slow and broken.,"Look at the 1 star reviews.Drive stupid slow and buggy.I think we've been scammed.. don't join the ""lose your money for nothing"" party by buying this drive."
4843,5,stores stuff,it stores
4844,5,Worth it.,Needed this from a while now and it’s worth it.
4845,5,"Lots of storage space, good price",Allowed me to clear up my computer + backup all my work from school. Highly recommend buying for organizing portfolio work + personal files.
4846,5,Works Great,Very easy to install on a PlayStation and takes very little time to setup
4847,5,Working very efficiently for my time machine backups,I like that this 5T capacity is small & lightweight.
4848,5,Great External Hard Drive,"Must Buy !! great price and great quality product, does what its intended to do!"
4849,4,Cheaper Option,"It’s a great portable drive.Nothing special.However, you can get the a Seagate 5TB portable drive for about $20 cheaper at Costco.I can’t seem to find any difference between the 2 other than the outer case?"
4850,5,It's good,It's good
4851,1,Doesnt work,"Bought this for my xbox and it doesnt work until i unplug it and plug it back in, now it kicks me off my games that are on the hard drive, terrible im going to try and get my money back"
4852,5,Amazing an affordable,As it should be
4853,5,Easy to use,Bought to use as external memory for ps4. Had no problems connecting and formatting. Very happy with this product so far.
4854,5,It’s a great external hard drive,
4855,4,So far so good,Got this a while ago and haven't had any problems as of now works as it's supposed to
4856,5,Good working.,It good
4857,5,Ideal drive,"2021.08.23 MRE:I have files scattered over three drives and bought this 16tb drive to consolidate them. I am using a Mac Pro (Late 2013) built in 2017. The computer recognized the drive the moment I plugged it in.I reformatted it using disk utility and have successfully moved files to it.I was impressed with the data transfer speed.It wasn't at warp speed, but it was quicker than others I've used. FYI, I am using a USB 3.0 port to connect to the drive."
4858,1,The HDD broke,"Literally, broke for a week of using it. If you travel a lot this is not ideal just buy yourself a shock proof portable HDD (SSD is my recommendation) if you happen to travel a lot. I think this is best when you are stationary in your room or something."
4859,5,Perfect,It worked great for PS4.
4860,3,Crashed,worked for 2 years & crashed
4861,5,VERY GOOD,VERY GOOD
4862,1,Sucks,Sucks for ps4 have to keep reformatting and eventually stopped working after 1 week complete garbage
4863,5,Great storage and easy to store.,Cheap and lots of storage.
4864,5,Perfect!,Easy to use and large capacity!
4865,4,Does what I bought it to do,"I bought this to put movies on for my 5 year old grandson as he knows how to use the computer and is very rough on the original dvds. I hook it up to my laptop and sit him near where I am working and it keeps him busy for as long as I need him to be busy. When he grows tired of the movies on it I load a few more. I only load movies that are appropriate for him and do not have to worry about child locks on my streaming services as he does not have to use them, just his harddrive from Grammy. I don't worry about data recovery because I retain all the original dvds and can just reload any movie that he messes up. It is basically the same thing I did with my kids only theirs were just music cassettes to play on their own tape players. I kept all the originals safe and replaced the ones they tore up."
4866,3,Annoying notifications,New xbox series s will send constant notifications that external hard drive is ready. One after the other till it is unplugged. Other than that it works great
4867,1,its okay u=ish,this hard drive is okay until 2 weeks because it decides to corrupt itself. its a very bad drive.
4868,4,Data store,Great product
4869,1,Defective,Right out of the box it turns on and off while connected to the computer.
4870,1,DO NOT GET: SUSCEPTIBLE TO VIRUSES AND ERRORS,"I bought this product back in June, and it has been less than 3 months and after multiple issues, this external hdd has finally died on me. Every few weeks after getting it I would get an error message when trying to access it when plugged into my pc. Even when I only had two game files: League of Legends and Apex Legends on it. At first, troubleshooting the problem with Windows fixed it, but now it is no longer able to fix it. The hdd keeps freezing my windows file explorer, to the point I have to soft reset my pc to access anything. Do not buy you will waste your money having to buy another from a different brand later."
4871,4,"Fast, works really well!",I'm using it to copy years of photoscans I did for my daughter.I was trying to use a 2TB thumb drive and kept having trouble.I was able to copy about 300GB from 2TB of data in a couple of hours.Tested the files on the drive and all the samples were good.Not sure but it seems more like an SSI drive instead of hard drive.
4872,4,Good 5 B external hard drive.,Works like it should. Time will tell about it's durability.
4873,3,good basic storage,"The 2TB storage is as advertised.Nothing fancy, easy to use -- plug in and use.Caution: transferring data can be ssslllooowww.That's the only complaint."
4874,5,Works perfect on my PS4,When my PS4 ran out of space for more games I found this. It works fantastic and Ive already loaded half a dozen games on it with no issue. Great product and low price!
4875,5,Exactly what it says,Great product
4876,5,Absolutely perfect Seagate at its finest,I absolutely love this hard drive especially where it's self-powered I had a three terabyte that was external powered and I dropped it and it went bad on me I was kind of surprised though because it had survived drops in the past but this new one is a lot smaller and has a lot more storage space and is worth every bit of what I paid for it
4877,5,Great Backup,My brother suggested this brand and back up. It works and I like it.
4878,5,👍super,it was siper
4879,4,Met expectations,Product met expectations.
4880,1,Plug lose connecting to hard drive,Bought this for my series x and the cord keeps coming lose from the hard drive.
4881,5,good,great because I need more space on my laptop
4882,1,Piece of junk,"I guess its ok for simple one file at a time I/O.But put any kind of load on it, and it will go belly up in less than a month.You get what you pay for if you are lucky, but with this cheap POS, you will not get even that"
4883,5,Funciona perfecto,Me ha funcionado perfecto como almacenamiento interno y casi igual de rápido a un disco de estado solido
4884,5,Great item,Definitely a great purchase
4885,1,Cambio mi opinión. No lo recomiendo,Se supone que es de 2 TB pero no deja almacenar sino 45GB. Hasta ahora me doy cuenta por que no habia necesitado más espacio
4886,1,"Box said 5 tb, hard drive was a 2tb",Pay attention that you are getting the right size you ordered.
4887,3,nice but s**t,worked great for the first week. now it randomly disconnects from my laptop every few hrs. tried changing power saving options on laptop to not shut down usb ports. went into driver options to fix to no avail. even tried seagates own software to fix it and it didnt work. dont know if i got a faulty drive but there it is.
4888,1,Destroyed my ps4,"This hard drive destroyed my PS4. I plugged it in and it worked beautifully for months and then I noticed it started acting strange. My PS4 would crash and tell me there was a storage issue, which I would restart the console like it said and then it would work fine again. Well tonight I was playing a game, just chilling out and then boom. PS4 turns off. try to get back in and it says I need to reconnect the HDD. So I do. It still doesn’t work. Won’t let me into the PlayStation because it refuses to let me connect my controller, even tho that’s what it says to do when it finally does turn on. Buy this if you want to brick your console."
4889,5,Should hold all of my xbox games,I used this for my Xbox games so I don't have to wait for it to download when I want to play.
4890,5,Seagate is #1,I’ve had 2 seperate 2TB HDs for years that are Seagate and they never got damaged. My WD and Toshiba HDs croaked after a couple of years.
4891,1,It mounted only once... A useless piece of crap.,"I am bringing it back to Costco. I've used their larger backups, and they have mostly worked fine.The lack of a power cord was kind of a dead giveaway, but I didn't realize that until I opened the package."
4892,5,Just what I needed.,I was desperately in need of this backup!
4893,2,Dead in a year.,"The drive was fine for near line media storage, but 1/3 of these drives died in a year.I think I will stick with Exos drives instead."
4894,5,Great,Great
4895,1,Defective Hard drive,"When I plug in the Hard drive, it only makes a low peeping sound on all of my computers.Product is defective.Please send me a new one.I cannot return this hard drive because I am from Belize.I am forced to write this review because I cannot leave this comment at the right place."
4896,5,"Simple and effective, no better way to put it","One single cable to connect it and it more than doubled my storage on my PS4, super simple to set up, had to go to devices and allow access is all I believe"
4897,5,Good Product,Works great
4898,5,Easy to install on a Mac.,"Great product, small, portable, large capacity for what I use it for."
4899,1,Really Bad Product. Terrible quality (,Junk!!! Stay away from it. It’s my second purchase and I lost all 4 TB of data again. It just doesn’t work long term. I tried to store 171 GB and it just freezes and not detectable by computer. Wasted hours and money.
4900,4,Very Nice and compact,I like the size and i purchased the case also.Love it
4901,1,Good for the prove but seems used,Great for the price but I might have received a used item. It wasn't packaged in a Seagate box and had a couple of scratches on the item.
4902,1,A CRAP ¡DONT BUY!,"What can I tell you, this hard drive is crap is not even two months old and it already makes a beep sound and does not connect. Basically it turns on but it does not work, all my information is lost, I have tried to fix it but it does not work and even the professionals told me that it is a bad buy. Don't waste your time, buy another from a brand that works for you.¡WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
4903,5,Works fine so far,Like that it works haha
4904,5,2TB!,for the price you cant beat it! 2tb is more than my computer and laptop combined.i have them both backed up on this HDi also have my game library on there to save space on my PCgreat little HD
4905,5,Decent price for storage,"Not sure it's capacity on computers but If you need storage space on consoles, particularly PS4, then I would recommend it."
4906,5,"Need one, Get one!",Big like!.......Excellent.
4907,1,"This HD is supposed to be new inbox.It's placed in a clear wrapper, inside a brown box?????","If I buy a digital device, and it's listed as NEW, it needs to be in the original packaging like Best Buy.The HD was placed in a plastic wrapper, inside a brown box????? WTHI am turning the HD on, if I have any trouble, I know why.In the future, if you sell an item at same price as Best Buy, have the original packaging, VERY MISLEADING."
4908,5,Shipped quick,Haven't used it but way cheaper than internal drives for ps5
4909,5,EZ,It gud
4910,5,Great with Mac boom,"Good storage, works with Mac book air…had to Google how to reset before use"
4911,1,Not for ps4 or Xbox!,"It’s listed above that this hard drive is compatible with pc, Mac, ps4 and Xbox but it’s only compatible with pc and Mac, just a heads up."
4912,1,Crashed after three months,"This drive required no special steps--just plugged into my MacBookPro and lit up just fine.But after three months I noticed that the OneTouch would sometimes not appear on the desktop.Then I had difficulty starting up my Mac until I disconnected the OneTouch.Reconnected the OneTouch and it crashed as well as crashing my Mac.Mac then started up normally after disconnecting the OneTouch, which was running noisy and very warm.Plugged it into my other M1 MacBook Air--drive did not appear and made strange noises.Obviously bricked.Was able to use my online backup to restore the volume on a new drive--a different brand."
4913,5,Used it for my son’s Xbox,So far so good my kids been using it for a couple of months now the Xbox 1
4914,5,Perfect for son,"The computer I bought for my son didn’t have enough memory, so I bought this product for him. It’s quick to set up, and it works great!"
4915,5,Absolutely recommend,"I bought this product (4tb) for my ps4 and ps5 and it works perfectly. Just connect it to the USB port and make sure to format as extended storage or else it won't work. Very portable, and small so it won't take up a lot of space. I have about 50 games installed and still have space for more."
4916,1,"Se daño a los 4 meses y no tengo solución, mal servicio para ayudarlo a uno.",Nunca salió de mi casa y no tenia ni medio disco lleno y tuvo fallo en el hardware
4917,5,STORAGE EFFICIENCY,"maaan oh man this product is a life saver. If you have no storage on your Xbox or PlayStation this is the best choice for you if you’re looking to add more games and get some bang for your buck. I’m very impressed with the quality of this item all around, the durability, the materials used to craft the item and you can fit it in your pocket! 5/5 I would highly recommend this product, keep up the good work!"
4918,1,Buyer Beware,Just received this and started to transfer my photos with no problem.Got up from the computer and walked by the drive and knocked it off the desk.The cord came out of the external hard drive.I plugged it back in and it is beeping.The devise fell onto carpeted floor and was not damaged.If this devise is thatdelicate I wouldn't trust it to hold all of my photos without some kind of problem developing.
4919,1,Won't transfer Raw or mp4 files,Will not transfer Raw files. Just keeps crashing or freezing my entire system.
4920,1,Had someone's information on it.It wasn't new.,Received this component with some else's information on it.I want a new virgin component.
4921,5,Works Great!,I used to copy data from an old computer to install on a new computer.I also store old files on it.
4922,5,The size of the device.,The size of the device.
4923,5,So far.....awesome.,"So far I am SUPER happy. Pic shows the relative small size. Plus for around a $100 this is a super good deal! Fine quality, performing on Xbox as desired. The only reason to not buy is if u want an SSD and not an HDD."
4924,1,Do you have Windows 11? You will have to copy and paste each file individually.,"Do you have Windows 11? You will have to copy and paste each file individually. This will take a LONG 455 TIME.Also you cannot use the eject icon because there is not eject icon if you have windows 11.If you have an MSI computer in the bottom right corner there is an up arrow... click that and click on seagate but your file folder, you know the one that you have to Copy and Paste individually any folders you want to backup) needs to be closed.If you don't have kids, a job or friends you should have enough extra time to backup your files onto this seagate 5T"
4925,4,I really recommend.,I really liked the fact that all i had to do was plug it in my pc and just click on the option to use it for space. Highly recommend.
4926,5,"1 month later, no regrets","This hard-drive is really good quality. I use it foe general file storage. Im surprised still, how its so small and yet its a 5TB drive."
4927,5,Needed/wanted separate storage for pictures and videos,"I was running out of space on my external hard drive and decided I wanted one strictly for my pictures and YouTube videos. I saw this one and the reviews were good. I like that it's small and has 5TB storage available for digital files. I noticed a lot of drives with 5TB only had about 500GB of digital storage space. I'm glad I read the specs.I've only have this about two weeks. It was easy to transfer files onto it. Easy to connect to my desktop and laptop. I won't be rewriting files on this drive, so I can't speak about that functionality.I'm enjoying this drive and being able to travel with it if I want to. It's not heavy and the case I purchased for it keeps is dust free and secure."
4928,1,Stopped working,bought it in may worked fine till now i dont know what happened this morning woke up and the thing stopped working well my xbox stopped detecting it and lost over 10 games
4929,1,Disappointed,"I've had a few of these over the years and they worked well. Quick. Responsive. Stored what I needed. This was has had issues from the beginning, due in large part to the connector port for the cable. 2TB of data capacity and I can't even get it to work. Pretty bummed. Some I managed to store photos and video files on it and am now having major issues getting it to work. Bummed."
4930,5,love it,greatproduct
4931,5,Amazing. Still using years later,None.
4932,5,Storage,This is worth the buy. Very easy to use just plug in and it's ready to go. I saved many videos on it and still has plenty of space.
4933,1,Wasted hours when it stopped working,"The drive worked well coming out of the box, though obviously slower than solid state drives.After a bit over a month (just outside the return window!), it intermittently failed as my Time Machine backup drive.I spent hours troubleshooting it before being told it's a problem with the drive.We then spent an hour online and on the phone arranging a prompt replacement (otherwise waiting for a week or two).With all that done, I should have just cut my losses, thrown it away, and bought some other brand.Now I need to return this bricked drive and hope that my private data isn't compromised.Very frustrating."
4934,5,Always works like a charm,"Never had any problems with these drives out of the box, nor for the first several years."
4935,5,Great Item,Perfect hard drive for gamers Amazon deliver same day
4936,5,"If using for Xbox, plug it in the front!",Plugged it in the back for some reason it didn't read it. Plugged it in the front and it read right away. Easy!
4937,5,Works great with Xbox one s,"Works as it should, no issues. Plug and play with Xbox one s"
4938,4,Good product. Excellent price.,"Unit has excellent capacity and read speed. It's write speed, however, is irritatingly slow."
4939,5,Great with PS4,Great storage for PS4. Hook up & go... Easy
4940,1,Buyer Beware,"Trash, had it 4 months and crashed."
4941,5,Easy and confident from A to Z,Needed to back up my home which led me to this confident quality of Seagate and couldn’t be easier.
4942,5,A good purchase,"I mistakenly thought this was a solid state drive when I bought it.I had been looking at various drive and this drives details did specify that it wasn't a solid state, so that's on me.I put it to use helping migrate data at work and it's been a solid asset.It got dropped once or twice....a couple times and functions fine.The case seems to have some shock absorbing qualities.I didn't intend to test them, but there you are."
4943,2,Get something better,"It was good while it lasted.. literally babied it, never let it leave my room or even touch the ground, and out of nowhere it stopped connecting to my xbox, started whirring and beeping loudly.. within the first month and a half i had it. Seriously, just get something better, i promise you its not worth it for you to deal with the bs of having to port 2tb of games to a new hard drive"
4944,5,Very Poggers,very sturdy a lot of space no damage on box ive had mine for like 3months or so and no problems so incredibly poggers
4945,5,Fast data transfer,"The device is compact, fast data transfer, a fantastic data storage."
4946,5,Great item thanks,Great item thanks
4947,4,I got a 1.8tb instead,"It was supposed to be a 2 tb, I know that 1.8tb is good but I asked for a 2 tb. So idk how to rate this"
4948,5,Games hard drive,Work great with xbox one s for extra game storage
4949,5,So far… Reliable and smooth operation.,Competitive price and a large amount of space with easy use and reliable performance. Nice small profile makes it easy to slip in the laptop case.
4950,5,"Faulty, making weird noise?","The media could not be loaded. Edit: I did process an exchange very easily through Amazon, and the second one worked perfectly! Exactly what I needed!As soon as I plugged this device in, it started making a weird clicking noise that wouldn’t stop. I’m assuming it’s the fan, but I’m going to exchange for one that hopefully works normally."
4951,1,Do not purchase,It has a 6 month life span
4952,1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!,"Well, this isn't looking good.This is advertised as a TWO TERABYTE hard drive.1.81 is not 2.0.In my opinion, I am owed a discount."
4953,5,Fast and reliable 👍,"Fits in the space that I set aside for it. It runs fast, and is very reliable and totally USB powered!"
4954,1,Stopped working after only 3 months.,"It worked for 3 months, sitting on a desk, not moving. Then one day it just stopped turning on.There's not much more to say."
4955,1,Stopped working 1 month after purchase,"Stopped working right after the rerun window, 1 month after purchase, so bought another one today. I hope this one works"
4956,5,Love it!,Like the speed and storage size.
4957,5,Excellent,"My computer only has a limited 128 GB of storage space, and this hard drive has saved my life.Very easy to use, and is perfect for traveling.If you ever have any memories you want to save for the future, this is a good hard drive to store them on.It also comes with warranty, so if your files are ever lost for some reason, you can get them replaced.Highly recommend."
4958,5,Great Backup Drive,"Fast easy backup.Small, lightweight and very portable.Nice drive."
4959,5,Lovnit,Storage capacity is great!
4960,2,"AVOID for large transfers, SMR drive slow as molasses. Eventually died after 10hrs of use.","Update 9/22After maybe 10hrs of use, put it away in a cabinet for a year. Took it out today only to find out it is unusable. It takes forever to be recognized and any write operation fail. I can hear heads retrying forever inside. This is poor quality product. Seagate used to be prime and innovative company, now it's just a dollar chasing far east corporation. Warranty replacement will probably get me refurbished one, that I will not trust and just use for temporary transfers. Skip this product.Original review:After the initial burst of high speed, this drive slows down to a crawl. Starts at 100MB/s+ for few minutes, than drops to average 6-8MB/s for the rest of the transfer, with occasional bursts to 10-30MB/s. 1.5TB of data is now estimated at 21h to complete. This is on a fresh drive out of the box. Obviously SMR drive. Absolute waste of time.If you are using it to occasionally backup few files, you'll be OK, if you are thinking about transferring large sets of data frequently, look elsewhere."
4961,5,"Great deal, works with ps4aa",Good for games
4962,1,Epic Fail,Cable that came with it never worked right had to then spend another 13 bucks on a new cable.
4963,5,Pretty good,I love it! works with my ps4
4964,5,😊,😊
4965,1,32 GB Storage Not 5TB,"I was really ripped off this time. Thanks for that. I paid over $100 USD on 08 August 2021 for this Seagate 5TB external hard drive. But, what I got was a 32GB external hard drive. I have 128GB thumb drives that cost me less than $20. This 5TB Seagate external hard drive is just a big black box with only 32GB. It's almost useless. Seagate should focus their efforts on producing an external hard drive that is actually 5TB instead of focusing on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I would return this piece of junk but it would cost too much to do so and they probably would just keep it and not refund me because I'm not Woke. I will Not buy anything from Seagate again."
4966,5,Nice and small yet holds a LOT!,"Simple, easy to use and reliable."
4967,5,No complaints,My son needed this for his computerNo complaintsDoes what it's intended to do
4968,5,Easy to install,This product is smaller and needs no electrical outlet unlike the external hard drive it replaced. It was easy to install on a mac. I was up and running in no time.
4969,5,El tigre,Bueno
4970,3,It's good when it is working,"The extra storage and setting up the hard drive is pretty easy, I've had my fair share of disconnecting issues as well as the wire is extremely faulty. Currently, after 2 months mine is unable to connect to my Xbox and Laptop leaving me pretty much with nothing to show for the next few days for customer support. The product isn't bad but expect to either buy a replacement or another wire in a short time."
4971,1,50% died in less than a year,"If you do much reading and writing to these, don't expect them to last more than a year."
4972,5,Good External Drive,We specifically looked for a Seagate drive because of their great reputation. We have had excellent customer service in the past.Great value for this 2TB back up drive for my MacBook Pro.
4973,1,Don’t work anymore for no reason,
4974,4,Prone to be damaged,It’s too small and looks not to bear a strike!
4975,2,Great but not great,"At first it was great but now day 4 of having it for the Xbox I have to keep playing with it because it goes off and basically have to reset it till it starts working again. Don’t know if others have the same issue or not but that how I feel about it.Update:it stopped working all together and wouldn’t work at all. Only lasted 3 days and had to return it. If getting it for the Xbox, get something different that made for Xbox."
4976,5,Small and powerfull!,"This is super easy to use, small enough to store or transport easily and all around a great buy!"
4977,5,Super fast shipping! Great quality,Super fast shipping! Great quality
4978,5,Amazing worth upgrading to 5TB!,So worth all the money for 5TB! In love with this thing for my PS4!
4979,1,Writes slow as he'll. Go get a ssd,It is very slow writing..should have just gotten a ssd
4980,5,Great,It's great works with my xbox
4981,4,Feels cheap compared to previous units.,"Ok. It feels cheap. Light. Plastic. Compared to earlier inits. However, it works just fine."
4982,5,Just what I needed for my photo files.,The hard drive was a great price and was just what I needed to save my old photos.Easy to use and I can store it in the packaging.
4983,1,product did not work,"The product would not allow us to back up. I finally decided to drag and drop everything over and after I did that when I tried to open the drive I got an error code saying.F:\is not accessible, the request failed due to a fatal device hardware error"
4984,5,Plug and Play!,"Very small and light, perfect backup and storage for the Laptop."
4985,1,DO NOT BUY EVER!!!! 70$ DOWN THE DRAIN,OBNOXIOUS CLICKING AND BEEPING SOUNDS!!!!!CORRUPTED FILES!!!!!!!!EXTREMELY SLOW WRITING SPEED!!!I ended miss placing the product packaging before using it and now I am unable to get my money back!
4986,5,Excellent,Plug and play
4987,4,So far so good,"Functioning as expected, fast transfer rate."
4988,5,👍👍👍,Good
4989,4,Pretty good,"Had some initial difficulty setting this up with a mac, but after that, works well"
4990,5,Works well,Works well
4991,1,Died under a month! in 20 years of dealing with IT this is the first time I see this!,"I don't believe my eyes. This simply stopped working. I received it on mid July and in less than a month it is simply not recognized! no matter the Operating System, cables, etc. It started to make a beep noise while in use and... died."
4992,4,Easy to operate. Thank you,Easy to operate... End-user friendly :)
4993,5,"Una buena inversion, la recomiendo",La utilizo con frecuencia y no tengo problemas. Tiene una buena velocidad de acceso a la información. La tengo con 0.7 teras de información
4994,5,Fast and no errors.,I needed a larger drive for my ripped DVD files and this does the job. It holds the movies I play on PLEX.
4995,5,Satisfied Customer,I love it. Extra storage for my PS4.
4996,5,A little slower than what I wanted. a good product,"This is a great product, since it did meet the description as advertised in the Amazon Website"
4997,3,Beware: Frustration Free Packaging,"Unfortunately did not come in original box but in ""Frustration Free Packaging""."
4998,1,Fool me twice,"Ibought this and it failed after the 2nd day, so i replaced it with the same product.CLICK OF DEATH out of the box.....this is junk!don't buy!"
4999,5,Reliable charger!,Very good portable charger- great battery life.
